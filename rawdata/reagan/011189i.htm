of the things about the Presidency is that you're always somewhat apart. You
spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving, and
seeing the people through tinted glass -- the parents holding up a child, and
the wave you saw too late and couldn't return. And so many times I wanted to
stop and reach out from behind the glass, and connect. Well, maybe I can do a

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I've
been thinking a bit at that window. I've been reflecting on what the past 8
years have meant and mean. And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a
nautical one -- a small story about a big ship, and a refugee, and a sailor. It
was back in the early eighties, at the height of the boat people. And the
sailor was hard at work on the carrier Midway, which was patrolling the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>South China Sea</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. The sailor, like most
American servicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant. The crew spied
on the horizon a leaky little boat. And crammed inside were refugees from </span><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. The Midway sent a
small launch to bring them to the ship and safety. As the refugees made their
way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck, and stood up, and
called out to him. He yelled, ``Hello, American sailor. Hello, freedom man.'' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
small moment with a big meaning, a moment the sailor, who wrote it in a letter,
couldn't get out of his mind. And, when I saw it, neither could I. Because
that's what it was to be an American in the 1980's. We stood, again, for
freedom. I know we always have, but in the past few years the world again --
and in a way, we ourselves -- rediscovered it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of '81 to '82, to the expansion that began in late '82 and continues to this

two things that I'm proudest of. One is the economic recovery, in which the
people of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

the world and looked to for leadership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this. It was back in 1981,
and I was attending my first big economic summit, which was held that year in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Canada</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. The meeting place
rotates among the member countries. The opening meeting was a formal dinner for
the heads of government of the seven industrialized nations. Now, I sat there
like the new kid in school and listened, and it was all Francois this and
Helmut that. They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a first-name
basis. Well, at one point I sort of leaned in and said, ``<span class=GramE>My</span>
name's Ron.'' Well, in that same year, we began the actions we felt would
ignite an economic comeback -- cut taxes and regulation, started to cut
spending. And soon the recovery began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two years later, another economic summit with
pretty much the same cast.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> At the big opening meeting we all got together,
and all of a sudden, just for a moment, I saw that everyone was just sitting
there looking at me. And then one of them broke the silence. ``Tell us about
the American miracle,'' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
back in 1980, when I was running for President, it was all so different. Some
pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe. Our views on foreign
affairs would cause war. Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to
soar and bring about economic collapse. I even remember one highly respected economist
saying, back in 1982, that ``<span class=GramE>The</span> engines of economic
growth have shut down here, and they're likely to stay that way for years to
come.'' Well, he and the other opinion leaders were wrong. The fact is, what
they called ``radical'' was really ``right.'' What they called ``dangerous''
was just ``desperately needed.''<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
in all of that time I won a nickname, ``The Great Communicator.'' But I never
thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference: it was the
content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and
they didn't spring full bloom from my brow, they came from the heart of a great
nation -- from our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles
that have guided us for two centuries. They called it the Reagan revolution.
Well, I'll accept that, but for me it always seemed more like the great
rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Common
sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce
less of it. So, we cut the people's tax rates, and the people produced more
than ever before. The economy bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and
could now grow quicker and stronger. Our economic program brought about the
longest peacetime expansion in our history: real family income up, the poverty
rate down, entrepreneurship booming, and an explosion in research and new
technology. We're exporting more than ever because American industry became
more competitive and at the same time, we summoned the national will to knock
down protectionist walls abroad instead of erecting them at home. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Common
sense also told us that to preserve the <span class=GramE>peace,</span> we'd
have to become strong again after years of weakness and confusion. So, we
rebuilt our defenses, and this New Year we toasted the new peacefulness around
the globe. Not only have the superpowers actually begun to reduce their
stockpiles of nuclear weapons -- and hope for even more progress is bright --
but the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease. The

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lesson of all this was, of course, that because we're a great nation, our
challenges seem complex. It will always be this way. But as long as we remember
our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours.
And something else we learned: Once you begin a great movement, there's no
telling where it will end. We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed
a world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away
from the ideologies of the past. For them, the great rediscovery of the 1980's
has been that, lo and behold, the moral way of government is the practical way
of government: Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly
productive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

birthday you can sit back sometimes, review your life, and see it flowing
before you. For me there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the
middle of my life. I never meant to go into politics. It wasn't my intention
when I was young. But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the
blessings bestowed on you. I was happy with my career in the entertainment
world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect

us. ``We the People'' are the driver; the government is the car. And we decide
where it should go, and by what route, and how fast. Almost all the world's
constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their
privileges are. Our Constitution is a document in which ``<span class=GramE>We</span>
the People'' tell the government what it is allowed to do. ``We the People''
are free. This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I've tried
to do these past 8 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

back in the 1960's, when I began, it seemed to me that we'd begun reversing the
order of things -- that through more and more rules and regulations and
confiscatory taxes, the government was taking more of our money, more of our
options, and more of our freedom. I went into politics in part to put up my
hand and say, ``Stop.'' I was a citizen politician, and it seemed the right

Even though our visit was a surprise, every Russian there immediately
recognized us and called out our names and reached for our hands. We were just
about swept away by the warmth. You could almost feel the possibilities in all
that joy. But within seconds, a KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began
pushing and shoving the people in the crowd. It was an interesting moment. It
reminded me that while the man on the street in the </span><st1:place><span

I want the new closeness to continue. And it will, as long as we make it clear
that we will continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act
