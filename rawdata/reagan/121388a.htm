<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
you know, I'll rest a whole lot easier knowing that I've left the White House
in good hands. There hasn't been a transition like this since Inauguration Day
in 1837, when Andrew Jackson turned the keys to the store over to Martin Van
Buren. And, no, I don't remember that day. [Laughter] When you get to be my

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
our critics on the other side and in the media say that the new President
doesn't have a mandate. But I just can't help wondering, if their candidate had
been the one to win by the second largest margin of any President running for a
first term in more than three decades, would they have said that he didn't have
a mandate? Have we ever had a clearer mandate? Strong judges, a strong defense,
and -- even people who can't read lips should have got this one by now -- no
new taxes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
yes, today, as in the past 8 years, it's true: We are the change, and this year
the American people shouted out loud and clear that they want the change to
continue. And I know that under President George Bush it will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
a change it's been. For what we've seen and been privileged to participate in
these last 8 years has been more than the victory of a program or the triumph
of a position on this issue or that. A force broader and deeper has moved in
our land, a force with the power and fury, the strength and grace, of a truth
whose time has come, a force that is rooted in the depths of this great and
noble experiment we call America: the force of freedom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> is the <span
class=GramE>course of an ancient and enduring struggle</span>, a struggle in
which we Americans have a special place. At its edges, this struggle is not so
much between good and evil, between absolute freedom and immediate slavery; but
between hope and despair, between those who shoulder the promise and the burden
of freedom and those who would -- in the name of a false determinism -- take us
a mile or two more down what Friedrich Hayek called the road to serfdom.
History records a few significant turning points in this epic struggle, and
surely in years to come it will tell that one of those turning points came
when, after a generation of gestation, a revolution of ideas became a
revolution of governance on </span><st1:date Year="1981" Day="20" Month="1"><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
I know that you've often heard me recall the condition of the <span
class=GramE>country,</span> and particularly of the economy before we took
office: soaring interest and inflation rates, lagging productivity and
investment, falling real family income, growing poverty, and stalled economic
growth. But the most remarkable thing about that time -- as bad as things were
becoming -- was not the hardship, but the attitude of our leaders. Too many of
our leaders told us that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'s troubles were the
fault of ``we, the American people,'' as if somehow we'd let our leaders down,
and not the other way around. They told us that we'd caught a disease called
``malaise.'' And then they turned around and told us that even if we reformed
there wasn't much we could do because great historic forces were at work, the
problems were all too complicated for solution, fate and history were against
us, and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> was slipping into an
inevitable decline. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
Whittaker Chambers once wrote that, in his words, ``Human societies, like human
beings, live by faith and die when faith dies.'' Well, there's a special faith
that has, from our earliest days, guided this sweet and blessed land. It was
proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence and enshrined in the
Constitution. It found a home in even our most remote frontier settlements, and
from every corner of the globe, it has drawn tens of millions of tempest-tossed
dreamers to our shores. Yes, it was what our founders meant when they inscribed
on our great seal the words that in translation say, ``A new order for the
ages.'' It is a faith in the wisdom and redeeming power of a free people. And
in saying that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> has entered an
inevitable decline, our leaders of just a decade ago were confessing that, in
them, this faith had died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
that's when the American people rounded up a posse, swore in this old sheriff,
and sent us riding into town, where the previous administration had said the
Nation's problems were too complicated to manage. Well, we said of course they
are; so government should stop trying to manage them, stop putting its faith in
the false god of bureaucracy, and trust the genius of the American people
instead. Yes, we said, it's time to return to the principles of our founders:
the principles of the Constitution and the principles of limited government --
free enterprise and respect for family, community, and faith. And as a first
step, we said that the way to restore vitality to the economy was to cut marginal
tax rates and cut needless regulations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
did both. We cut the top tax rate in the 1981 tax act, and then we cut it again
in the 1986 tax reform. Our cuts in needless regulations have been at least as
significant; and as with tax cuts, other countries, including Japan, are
rushing to catch up. Of just one of these reforms, the streamlining of the Food
and Drug Administration review of new drugs to treat AIDS, cancer, and other
devastating diseases, the Wall Street Journal wrote almost 2 years ago, and I'm
quoting now: ``Among the initiatives of the Reagan administration, it will rank
with tax cuts and the Strategic Defense Initiative.''<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
you know the results of what we called in the 1980 campaign our economic
recovery program: the longest peacetime economic expansion on record -- almost
19 million new jobs <span class=GramE>created,</span> real family income up
over 10 percent, poverty rate down, interest rates and inflation way down. In
fact, Milton Friedman has suggested that when improvements in product quality
are taken into account, underlying inflation may have disappeared altogether.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile,
we're in the middle of the greatest boom in entrepreneurship in our history and
the greatest explosion of research and new technology in all of the entire
industrial revolution. This entire industrial revolution boosted productivity
-- or that original one did -- by a factor of a hundred. But according to
Carver Mead, the godfather of the semiconductor: ``<span class=GramE>The</span>
microelectronic revolution has already enhanced productivity in
information-based technology by a factor of more than a million, and the end
isn't in sight yet.''<o:p></o:p></span></p>

industries are exporting more than ever before. But that would never have
happened if, with the American people behind us, we hadn't kept domestic
protectionist forces at bay while we opened markets abroad -- another major
achievement. And with the coming implementation of the U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement, the century's third try at a free trade agreement between our
countries, and a new GATT round, we're taking giant steps toward a new era of
free and fair trade throughout the world and a new era of growth here at home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>World leaders have, in my presence, shaken their
heads in wonderment and spoken with awe of the ``American miracle.''</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> And you know that we're
doing something to the way people think when a Socialist Prime Minister of
Italy says in public, as happened a while back, that our policies are so
successful as to, in his words, ``make not only Italy but the whole of Europe
think.'' And then, echoing him, the chief economic spokesman of -- of all
things -- the Italian Communist Party added, and again I'm quoting: ``<span
class=GramE>The</span> old ideas of socialism are in crisis. It is the problem
of <span class=SpellE>statism</span>, a program that doesn't take into account
individual needs and values.'' I could have told them <span class=GramE>that
years</span> ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
here at home again, we worked with a bipartisan coalition in Congress to save a
faltering Social Security system from bankruptcy, to enact a pay-as-you-go plan
that helps free the elderly from financial consequences of catastrophic
illness, and to reform our welfare system. Our welfare system now includes
strengthened requirements that fathers help support their children and, for the
first time, work requirements for those able to work. At the same time, we've
prompted even bolder State experiments with welfare reform, as well as State
experiments with a bright ray of hope for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

zones. And we've begun to test selling public housing units to the tenants who
live in them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
not everything we did can or should be measured in dollars and cents. ``Justice
is the end of government,'' wrote de Tocqueville. He said we would appoint
judges who understood crime, criminals, and the Constitution; and we have. As
our judicial appointees have begun to fill the bench, Federal sentences have
grown a third longer than in 1980. And now on the Supreme Court and our appeals
courts, we have more and more Justices and judges who appreciate the hardships
of police work, who can see the distinction between the criminal and the victim
of crime, and who know the difference between making the law and interpreting
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
talking about crime, I think it's a crime that one of the best men ever
nominated was kept off the United States Supreme Court: Robert Bork. But even
so, who knows, maybe in the next few years, the courts will even figure out
what the American people know: that the right to abortion is not in the
Constitution and the right to pray, including for schoolchildren to pray, is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
1982 I announced to the Nation that we were going to go after the mob like no
other administration in history. Within a few years, organized crime
convictions had quadrupled. Today we have the mob on the ropes. We're going to
keep them there. Yes, we launched a war on organized crime and on drugs.
Federal drug convictions have nearly tripled. Cocaine seizures are up 1,800
percent. And it seems as if almost every week, of late, brings news of another
international roundup of gangsters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We've
put the Federal Government on the side of children and families, going after
child pornographers while working with Congress virtually to end Federal

quality to our schools. State after State and school system after school system
have introduced reforms, from merit pay for teachers to getting back to basics
-- the four R's: <span class=SpellE>readin</span>', <span class=SpellE>writin</span>',
'<span class=SpellE>rithmetic</span>, and respect for the teacher -- and return
an appreciation of fundamental values to America's classrooms. For as Teddy

while our feet have been planted on the ground, our eyes have been turned
toward the stars. We have overcome tragedy and pushed forward on such visionary
projects as the space station and the space plane, even as we've cleared the
way for development of a private launch industry and for the commercial
development of space. I believe that the opening of space to the questing
dynamism of our free enterprise system may turn out to be among the most
significant developments in space exploration since the first landing on the
Moon. Combine that with the renaissance in private research that our economic
policies have spawned and our commitment to fields of research ranging from
AIDS-related studies of the immunological system to the superconducting
supercollider, and who can doubt that American technology will continue to set
the pace for the world in the generation ahead? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
from the economy to science and in every other field, we've followed the lead
of the American people these last 8 years and chosen hope. Like the American
people, we've chosen always to stand on the side of family and opportunity and
freedom. We have looked back to the kind of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
as we look ahead, there is, of course, one area in particular where work is
still left to do: the budget. In 52 of the last 56 years, the House of
Representatives has been in the hands of the other party; and both Houses of
Congress for 46 of those 56 years. And in all but 8 of those years, the
Government has run a deficit. And under the Constitution, only Congress can
spend money; the President can't appropriate a penny. Even so, with Congress
dragged along kicking and screaming, we've made remarkable progress. We have
slowed the rate of growth in Federal spending to a third of what it was the
year before we took office. And we have transformed the debate on the budget; you
don't hear people argue anymore that deficits are good or that they don't
matter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still,
it's no secret that one of my great disappointments as I leave office is that
the Federal budget itself is not yet balanced. I've given our experience with
the budget a great deal of thought. And I would like to speak for a moment
about one of the principal lessons I have learned, a lesson that I believe that
has lasting importance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
sometimes seems <span class=GramE>to</span> many Americans that what might be
called a triangle of institutions -- parts of Congress, the media, and special
interest groups -- is transforming and placing out of focus our constitutional
balance, particularly in the areas of spending and foreign policy. Some have
used the term ``iron triangle'' to describe something like what I'm talking
about, and with apologies to them, I'll borrow that term.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
measure of this iron triangle's power derives from its permanence.
Administrations come and go, but the members of the iron triangle endure. Even
the body that the framers of our Constitution intended to be the most
vulnerable to shifts in public attitudes, the House of Representatives, has --
with a combination of gerrymandering, changes in campaign finance rules, and
the powers of the incumbency -- become a virtually permanent chamber, no longer
truly responsive to the people. With a 98-percent rate of reelection, there is <span
class=GramE>less turnover</span> in the House than in the Supreme Soviet, and a
seat in Congress is one of the most secure jobs in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the iron triangle's power also comes from its ability to focus debate and
overwhelming resources -- like campaign money and letter writing campaigns --
on issues that don't command broad and intense national attention. Yes, as I
said a moment ago, thanks to us, most liberals are now afraid to discuss new
spending. But go one step into greater detail, to the merits of this or that
restraint on spending, and the iron triangle has virtually shut off public
debate. Special interest groups focus all their resources and members on this
line or that in the budget. And Members of Congress, particularly liberal
Members, with their dependence on special interest campaign financing and their
fear of bucking any group that is strongly committed to a spending program,
take up the banner and join the charge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
helps the special interests that the Government spends a great deal of money
without Congress ever casting a vote. Now, I'm not talking here about Social
Security, but of the many formula spending programs. When we came to town,
bracket creep let Congress raise taxes without voting a tax increase. With
indexing and by beating down inflation, we stopped that. But the same thing has
not happened with formula spending. The result is that it's easier for most
Members of Congress to lay low and do nothing than to take the political heat
of voting for a change.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You'd
think the media might act as a check on all this, but too often it doesn't.
Now, let me say, no one who sits in my seat can have anything but the greatest
respect for the media and the role they play in our system. But it is also
clear that too many members of the media approach issues like Federal spending
from a superficial perspective. Our positions are reported in caricature.
Special interest charges are reported uncritically, and the public's
understanding suffers. Shouldn't we expect better of those who act in the name
of the public's right to know? [Applause]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
we're talking about here is the very thing our Constitution was designed to
protect us against: a rise in the power of what </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

believe the budget crisis would not be nearly so serious today had not the
Constitution itself been, in essence, rewritten nearly 15 years ago, upsetting
the calculus of consent within our system and opening the way for the situation
we now have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'm
speaking of the Budget Act of 1974. In a recent article in Commentary magazine,
legal commentator L. Gordon <span class=SpellE>Crovitz</span> wrote that the
act, in his words, ``was crafted by Congress to rob the President of the
ability to limit spending while making it possible for a fragmented collection
of Congressmen to spend and, at the same time, to evade responsibility for
doing so.''<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
as originally drafted, the 1974 act would have replaced the President's disciplining
role in the budget process with institutional disciplines within Congress. But
some complained that the proposed plan would, quoting a study paper of the
time, ``lock the congressional budget process into a conservative mold for
generations to come.'' Well, Congress fixed that and changed the plan. And
while, as I said, we've run deficits for most of the past five and a half
decades, the really big deficits started coming immediately after the act was
passed, and they've kept right on rolling ever since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Can
you imagine a situation where any head of a company or head of a household is
forced to spend every dime? But that's the situation the President is in now.
If Congress appropriates it, the President has to spend it, whether he needs
all the money to do the job or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
why do we have deficits? It's not because of a lack of revenues. Federal
revenues have grown by $375 billion since 1981. But spending has grown by $450
billion. And for the record, less than $140 billion of the spending increase
went to defense. Next year, we expect revenues to increase by another $80
billion without new taxes. So, the challenge before us is setting spending
priorities, deciding where to spend some of the additional revenue, but not
spending it all so we can reduce the deficit. Now, that shouldn't be so hard,
but history suggests that Congress will want to spend it all and then some. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
I came to office, I found in the Presidency a weakened institution. I found a
Congress that was trying to transform our government into a quasi-parliamentary
system. And I found a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I've
used the President's ability to frame the broadest outlines of debate to
compensate for some of the weakening of the office. This year we also put an
end -- I hope for good -- to the use of monster continuing resolutions to make
the congressional budget veto-proof. But we have not restored the
constitutional balance, at least not fully, and I believe it must be restored. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the long run, the situation we have now isn't good for anyone -- even the
members of the iron triangle. Fundamentally, the American people know what's
up, and they don't like it. They may reelect their Congressmen, but they trust
Congress itself less and less. They may watch or read the media, but they stop
believing it. And they show more and more dislike for special interest
influence. The only question is: When will they say once and for all that
they've had enough? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

American people. The budget deficit is the colony's last stand. In the last 8
years, we've taken giant steps toward shutting down their game of
tax-and-spend. We've succeeded as much as we have because even if the American
people can't follow every issue that has its day in this city, in the end they
know how the chips are falling. I believe that soon they'll be saying with
greater and greater force that it's time to restore our constitutional balance.
And I believe that they'll join us in saying that the place to start is with
enhanced rescission authority and a line-item veto for the President, with the
balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Do that, and the Federal budget
deficit will be ancient history in no time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

throughout the world. Writer George Gilder has said that we have ``launched a
global revival of capitalism.'' And, yes, the days are gone when, for example,
a British intellectual like historian A.J.P. Taylor could say that ``Nobody in
Europe believes in the American way of life, that is, private enterprise.''

example of private enterprise has an almost irresistible appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the hopelessness of one who, despite his courage and conviction,
nevertheless knows that years in the gulag are ahead of him and his once normal
life is behind. And then in that moment his eyes lit on a scratching of
graffiti left by another prisoner of conscience, also a <span class=SpellE>refusenik</span>.
It said simply, ``<span class=GramE>Be</span> strong and courageous,'' and it

free in body as well as spirit. But our success these last 8 years is also a
message of hope to those who yearn for freedom all over the world. We've put
the lie to the myth of determinism and despair, and reaffirmed that no force in
this world can match that of the robust spirit of free men and women. Political
philosopher Michael Novak has written that ``<span class=GramE>The</span> major
division in American politics is not economic but moral.'' And so it is,
freedom and hope versus determinism and despair, and thanks to men and women
like you, the cause of hope and freedom is on the march. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
