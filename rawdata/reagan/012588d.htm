in this historic Chamber to continue that work. If anyone expects just a proud

your <span class=SpellE>workshoes</span>; we're still on the job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>History
records the power of the ideas that brought us here those 7 years ago -- ideas
like the individual's right to reach as far and as high as his or her talents
will permit; the free market as an engine of economic progress. And as an
ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao-tzu, said: ``Govern a great nation as you
would cook a small fish; do not overdo it.'' [Laughter] Well, these ideas were
part of a larger notion, a vision, if you will, of America herself -- an
America not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an America, too, of
strong families and vibrant neighborhoods; an America whose divergent but
harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values: the
value of work, of family, of religion, and of the love of freedom that God
places in each of us and whose defense He has entrusted in a special way to
this nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr. Gorbachev was here --
the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind began with
three simple words: ``We the People,'' the revolutionary notion that the people
grant government its rights, and not the other way around. And there's one
lesson that has come home powerfully to me, which I would offer to you now.
Just as those who created this Republic pledged to each other their lives,
their fortunes, and their sacred honor, so, too, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, let us affirm that in
this Chamber tonight there are no Republicans, no Democrats -- just Americans.
Yes, we will have our differences, but let us always remember what unites us
far outweighs whatever divides us. Those who sent us here to serve them -- the
millions of Americans watching and listening tonight -- expect this of us.
Let's prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election
year. We've done this before. And as we have worked together to bring down
spending, tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights;
America has created more jobs and better, higher paying jobs; family income has
risen for 4 straight years, and America's poor climbed out of poverty at the
fastest rate in more than 10 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but an economic
and social revolution of hope based on work, incentives, growth, and
opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives

moment in world history reclaimed and restored the American dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
in a few moments, I'm going to talk about three developments -- arms reduction,
the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the global democratic revolution -- that,
when taken together, offer a chance none of us would have dared imagine 7 years
ago, a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era.
I speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both
totalitarianism and nuclear terror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tonight,
then, we're strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free. This is the state of
our </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. And if we will work
together this year, I believe we can give a future President and a future
Congress the chance to make that prosperity, that peace, that freedom not just
the state of our </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Toward
this end, we have four basic objectives tonight. First, steps we can take this
year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children a future of
low inflation and full employment. Second, let's check our progress in
attacking social problems, where important gains have been made, but which
still need critical attention. I mean schools that work, economic independence
for the poor, restoring respect for family life and family values. Our third objective
tonight is global: continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions
we've seen around the world. Fourth and finally, our nation has remained at
peace for nearly a decade and a half, as we move toward our goals of world
prosperity and world freedom. We must protect that peace and deter war by
making sure the next President inherits what you and I have a moral obligation
to give that President: a national security that is unassailable and a national
defense that takes full advantage of new technology and is fully funded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is a full agenda. It's meant to be. You see, my thinking on the next year is
quite simple: Let's make this the best of 8. And that means it's all out --
right to the finish line. I don't buy the idea that this is the last year of
anything, because we're not talking here tonight about registering temporary
gains but ways of making permanent our successes. And that's why our focus is
the values, the principles, and ideas that made </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> great. Let's be clear
on this point. We're for limited government, because we understand, as the
Founding Fathers did, that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and
empowering the individual so that every American of every race and region
shares fully in the flowering of American prosperity and freedom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
other thing we Americans like -- the future -- like the sound of it, the idea
of it, the hope of it. Where others fear trade and economic growth, we see
opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed-of opportunities for
millions in our own land and beyond. Where others seek to throw up barriers, we
seek to bring them down. Where others take counsel of their fears, we follow
our hopes. Yes, we Americans like the future and like making the most of it.
Let's do that now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
let's begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling and
eventually eliminating the problem of Federal deficits. We have had a balanced
budget only eight times in the last 57 years. For the first time in 14 years,
the Federal Government spent less in real terms last year than the year before.
We took $73 billion off last year's deficit compared to the year before. The
deficit itself has moved from 6.3 percent of the gross national product to only
3.4 percent. And perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the
change in our view of deficits. You know, a few of us can remember when, not
too many years ago, those who created the deficits said they would make us
prosperous and not to worry about the debt, because we owe it to ourselves.
Well, at last there is agreement that we can't spend ourselves rich.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
recent budget agreement, designed to reduce Federal deficits by $76 billion
over the next 2 years, builds on this consensus. But this agreement must be
adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past: more broken promises
and more unchecked spending. As I indicated in my first State of the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, what ails us can be
simply put: The Federal Government is too big, and it spends too much money. I
can assure you, the bipartisan leadership of Congress, of my help in fighting
off any attempt to bust our budget agreement. And this includes the swift and
certain use of the veto power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
it's also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to controlling
Federal deficits. The simple but frustrating problem of making expenses match
revenues -- something American families do and the Federal Government can't --
has caused crisis after crisis in this city. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, I will
say to you tonight what I have said before and will continue to say: The budget
process has broken down; it needs a drastic overhaul. With each ensuing year,
the spectacle before the American people is the same as it was this Christmas:
budget deadlines delayed or missed completely, monstrous continuing resolutions
that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one bill, and
a Federal Government on the brink of default.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
know I'm echoing what you here in the Congress have said, because you suffered
so directly. But let's recall that in 7 years, of 91 appropriations bills
scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date, only 10 made it on time. Last
year, of the 13 appropriations bills due by October 1st, none of them made it.
Instead, we had four continuing resolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and
2 days, and 3 days, respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then, along came these behemoths. This is the conference report -- 1,053 pages,
report weighing 14 pounds. Then this -- a reconciliation bill 6 months late that
was 1,186 pages long, weighing 15 pounds. And the long-term continuing
resolution -- this one was 2 months late, and it's 1,057 pages long, weighing
14 pounds. That was a total of 43 pounds of paper and ink. You had 3 hours --
yes, 3 hours -- to consider each, and it took 300 people at my Office of
Management and Budget just to read the bill so the Government wouldn't shut
down. Congress shouldn't send another one of these. No, and if you do, I will
not sign it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let's
change all this. Instead of a Presidential budget that gets discarded and a
congressional budget resolution that is not enforced, why not a simple
partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities within the
available revenues? And let's remember our deadline is October 1st, not
Christmas. Let's get the people's work done in time to avoid a footrace with
Santa Claus. [Laughter] And, yes, this year -- to coin a phrase -- a new
beginning: 13 individual bills, on time and fully reviewed by Congress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'm
also certain you join me in saying: Let's help ensure our future of prosperity
by giving the President a tool that, though I will not get to use it, is one I
know future Presidents of either party must have. Give the President the same
authority that 43 Governors use in their States: the right to reach into
massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, and enforce budget
discipline. Let's approve the line-item veto. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
let's take a partial step in this direction. Most of you in this Chamber didn't
know what was in this catchall bill and report. Over the past few weeks, we've
all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there. For
example, there's millions for items such as cranberry research, blueberry
research, the study of crawfish, and the commercialization of wildflowers. And
that's not to mention the five or so million [$.5 million] that -- so that
people from developing nations could come here to watch Congress at work.
[Laughter] I won't even touch that. [Laughter] So, tonight I offer you this
challenge. In 30 days I will send back to you those items as rescissions, which
if I had the authority to line them out I would do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
review this multibillion-dollar package that will not undercut our bipartisan
budget agreement. As a matter of fact, if adopted, it will improve our deficit
reduction goals. And what an example we can set, that we're serious about

is another vital reform. Yes, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings has been profoundly
helpful, but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent.
Let us do now what so many States do to hold down spending and what 32 State
legislatures have asked us to do. Let us heed the wishes of an overwhelming
plurality of Americans and pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a
balanced budget and forces the Federal Government to live within its means.
Reform of the budget process -- including the line-item veto and balanced
budget amendment -- will, together with real restraint on government spending,
prevent the Federal budget from ever again ravaging the family budget.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ensure that the Federal Government never again legislates against the family
and the home. Last September I signed an Executive order on the family
requiring that every department and agency review its activities in light of
seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family. But let us make
certain that the family is always at the center of the public policy process
not just in this administration but in all future administrations. It's time
for Congress to consider, at the beginning, a statement of the impact that
legislation will have on the basic unit of American society, the family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
speaking of the family, let's turn to a matter on the mind of every American
parent tonight: education. We all know the sorry story of the sixties and
seventies -- soaring spending, plummeting test scores -- and that hopeful trend
of the eighties, when we replaced an obsession with dollars with a commitment
to quality, and test scores started back up. There's a lesson here that we all
should write on the blackboard a hundred times: In a child's education, money
can never take the place of basics like discipline, hard work, and, yes,
homework.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a nation we do, of course, spend heavily on education -- more than we spend on
defense. Yet across our country, Governors like New Jersey's Tom <span
class=SpellE>Kean</span> are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend
is as important as how much we spend. Opening up the teaching profession to all
qualified candidates, merit pay -- so that good teachers get A's as well as
apples -- and stronger curriculum, as Secretary Bennett has proposed for high
schools -- these imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popular
new kid in America's schools. How can we help? Well, we can talk about and push
for these reforms. But the most important thing we can do is to reaffirm that
control of our schools belongs to the States, local communities and, most of
all, to the parents and teachers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

friends, some years ago, the Federal Government declared war on poverty, and
poverty won. [Laughter] Today the Federal Government has 59 major welfare
programs and spends more than $100 billion a year on them. What has all this
money done? Well, too often it has only made poverty harder to escape. Federal
welfare programs have created a massive social problem. With the best of
intentions, government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very
support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty: the
family. Dependency has become the one enduring heirloom, passed from one

can catch fire and become guiding lights. States have begun to show us the way.
They've demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more
effective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs requiring
welfare recipients to work or prepare for work. Let us give the States more

seen such changes in the world in 7 years. As totalitarianism struggles to
avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance and the aspiration
for human freedom, it is the free nations that are resilient and resurgent. As
the global democratic revolution has put totalitarianism on the defensive, we
have left behind the days of retreat. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

occurring again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

my thoughts tonight go beyond this, and I hope you'll let me end this evening
with a personal reflection. You know, the world could never be quite the same
again after Jacob <span class=SpellE>Shallus</span>, a trustworthy and
dependable clerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, took his pen and
engrossed those words about representative government in the preamble of our
Constitution. And in a quiet but final way, the course of human events was
