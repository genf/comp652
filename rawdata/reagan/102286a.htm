<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Well,
thank you, and welcome to the White House. In a moment I'll be sitting at that
desk, taking up a pen, and signing the most sweeping overhaul of our tax code
in our nation's history. To all of you here today who've worked so long and
hard to see this day come, my thanks and the thanks of a nation go out to <span
class=GramE>you.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>The
journey's been long, and many said we'd never make it to the end. But as usual
the pessimists left one thing out of their calculations: the American people.
They haven't made this the freest country and the mightiest economic force on
this planet by shrinking from challenges. They never gave up. And after almost
3 years of commitment and hard work, one headline in the Washington Post told
the whole story: ``The Impossible Became the Inevitable,'' and the dream of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

became a reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

marginal tax rates and the most modern tax code among major industrialized
nations, one that encourages risk-taking, innovation, and that old American
spirit of enterprise. We'll be refueling the American growth economy with the
kind of incentives that helped create record new businesses and nearly 11.7
million jobs in just 46 months. Fair and simpler for most Americans, this is a
tax code designed to take us into a future of technological invention and
economic achievement, one that will keep </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

into the 21st century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>But
for all tax reform's economic benefits, I believe that history will record this
moment as something more: as the return to the first principles. This country
was founded on faith in the individual, not groups or classes, but faith in the
resources and bounty of each and every separate human soul. Our Founding
Fathers designed a democratic form of government to enlist the individual's
energies and fashioned a Bill of Rights to protect its freedoms. And in so
doing, they tapped a wellspring of hope and creativity that was to completely
transform history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>The
history of these </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States of America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> is indeed a history of
individual achievement. It was their hard work that built our cities and farmed
our prairies; their genius that continually pushed us beyond the boundaries of
existing knowledge, reshaping our world with the steam engine, polio vaccine,
and the silicon chip. It was their faith in freedom and love of country that
sustained us through trials and hardships and through wars, and it was their
courage and selflessness that enabled us to always prevail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>But
when our Founding Fathers designed this government -- of, by, and for the people
-- they never imagined what we've come to know as the progressive income tax.
When the income tax was first levied in 1913, the top rate was only 7 percent
on people with incomes over $500,000. Now, that's the equivalent of
multimillionaires today. But in our lifetime we've seen marginal tax rates
skyrocket as high as 90 percent, and not even the poor have been spared. As tax
rates escalated, the tax code grew ever more tangled and complex, a haven for
special interests and tax manipulators, but an impossible frustration for
everybody else. Blatantly unfair, our tax code became a source of bitterness
and discouragement for the average taxpayer. It wasn't too much to call it
un-American. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Meanwhile,
the steeply progressive nature of the tax struck at the heart of the economic
life of the individual, punishing that special effort and extra hard work that
has always been the driving force of our economy. As government's hunger for
ever more revenues expanded, families saw tax cuts -- or taxes, I should say,
cut deeper and deeper into their paychecks; and taxation fell most cruelly on
the poor, making a difficult climb up from poverty even harder. Throughout
history, the oppressive hand of government has fallen most heavily on the
economic life of the individuals. And more often than not, it is inflation and
taxes that have undermined livelihoods and constrained their freedoms. We
should not forget that this nation of ours began in a revolt against oppressive
taxation. Our Founding Fathers fought not only for our political rights but
also to secure the economic freedoms without which these political freedoms are
no more than a shadow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>In
the last 20 years we've witnessed an expansion and strengthening of many of our
civil liberties, but our economic liberties have too often been neglected and
even abused. We protect the freedom of expression of the author, as we should,
but what of the freedom of expression of the entrepreneur, whose pen and paper
are capital and profits, whose book may be a new invention or small business?
What of the creators of our economic life, whose contributions may not only
delight the mind but improve the condition of man by feeding the poor with new
grains, bringing hope to the sick with new cures, vanishing ignorance with wondrous
new information technologies? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>And what about fairness for families?</span></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> It's in our families
that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>'s most important work
gets done: raising our next generation. But over the last 40 years, as
inflation has shrunk the personal exemption, families with children have had to
shoulder more and more of the tax burden. With inflation and bracket-creep also
eroding incomes, many spouses who would rather stay home with their children
have been forced to go looking for jobs. And what of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>'s promise of hope and
opportunity, that with hard work even the poorest among us can gain the
security and happiness that is the due of all Americans? You can't put a <span
class=SpellE>pricetag</span> on the American dream. That dream is the heart and
soul of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>; it's the promise that keeps
our nation forever good and generous, a model and hope to the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>For
all these reasons, this tax bill is less a freedom -- or a reform, I should
say, than a revolution. Millions of working poor will be dropped from the tax
rolls altogether, and families will get a long-overdue break with lower rates
and an almost doubled personal exemption. We're going to make it economical to
raise children again. Flatter rates will mean more reward for that extra
effort, and vanishing loopholes and a minimum tax will mean that everybody and
every corporation pay their fair share. And that's why I'm certain that the
bill I'm signing today is not only an historic overhaul of our tax code and a
sweeping victory for fairness, it's also the best antipoverty bill, the best <span
class=SpellE>profamily</span> measure, and the best job-creation program ever
to come out of the Congress of the United States. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>And
now that we've come this far, we cannot, and we will not, allow tax reform to
be undone with tax rate hikes. We must restore certainty to our tax code and
our economy. And I'll oppose with all my might any attempt to raise tax rates
on the American people, and I hope that all here will join with me to make
permanent the historic progress of tax reform. I think all of us here today know
what a Herculean effort it took to get this landmark bill to my desk. That
effort didn't start here in Washington, but began with the many thinkers who
have struggled to return economics to its classical roots -- to an
understanding that ultimately the economy is not made up of aggregates like
government spending and consumer demand, but of individual men and women, each
striving to provide for his family and better his or her lot in life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>But
we must also salute those courageous leaders in the Congress who've made this
day possible. To Bob Packwood, Dan Rostenkowski, Russell Long, John Duncan, and
Majority Leader Bob Dole; to Jack Kemp, Bob <span class=SpellE>Kasten</span>,
Bill Bradley, and Dick Gephardt, who pioneered with their own versions of tax
reform -- I salute all of you and all the other Members of the Senate and House
whose efforts paid off and whose votes finally won the day. And last but not
least, the many members of the administration who must often have felt that
they were fighting a lonely battle against overwhelming odds -- particularly my
two incomparable Secretaries of the Treasury, Don Regan and Jim Baker -- and I
thank them from the bottom of my heart. I feel like we just played the World
Series of tax reform -- [laughter] -- and the American people won. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
