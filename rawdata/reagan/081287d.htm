<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I've
said on several occasions that I wouldn't comment about the recent
congressional hearings on the Iran-contra matter until the hearings were over.
Well, that time has come, so tonight I want to talk about some of the lessons
we've learned. But rest assured<span class=GramE>,</span> that's not my sole
subject this evening. I also want to talk about the future and getting on with
things, because the people's business is waiting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
past 9 months have been confusing and painful ones for the country. I know you
have doubts in your own minds about what happened in this whole episode. What I
hope is not in doubt, however, is my commitment to the investigations
themselves. So far, we've had four investigations -- by the Justice Department,
the Tower board, the Independent Counsel, and the Congress. I requested three
of those investigations, and I endorsed and cooperated fully with the fourth --
the congressional hearings -- supplying over 250,000 pages of White House
documents, including parts of my own private diaries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
I realized I hadn't been fully informed, I sought to find the answers. Some of
the answers I don't like. As the Tower board reported, and as I said last
March, our original initiative rapidly got all tangled up in the sale of arms,
and the sale of arms got tangled up with hostages. Secretary Shultz and
Secretary Weinberger both predicted that the American people would immediately
assume this whole plan was an arms-for-hostages deal and nothing more. Well,
unfortunately, their predictions were right. As I said to you in March, I let
my preoccupation with the hostages intrude into areas where it didn't belong.
The image -- the reality -- of Americans in chains, deprived of their freedom
and families so far from <span class=GramE>home,</span> burdened my thoughts.
And this was a mistake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
fellow Americans, I've thought long and often about how to explain to you what
I intended to accomplish, but I respect you too much to make excuses. The fact
of the matter is that there's nothing I can say that will make the situation
right. I was stubborn in my pursuit of a policy that went astray.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other major issue of the hearings, of course, was the diversion of funds to the
Nicaraguan contras. Colonel North and Admiral Poindexter believed they were
doing what I would have wanted done -- keeping the democratic resistance alive
in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nicaragua</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. I believed then and I
believe now in preventing the Soviets from establishing a beachhead in </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Central America</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. Since I have been so
closely associated with the cause of the contras, the big question during the
hearings was whether I knew of the diversion. I was aware the resistance was
receiving funds directly from third countries and from private efforts, and I
endorsed those endeavors wholeheartedly; but -- let me put this in capital
letters -- I did not know about the diversion of funds. Indeed, I didn't know
there were excess funds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
the buck does not stop with Admiral Poindexter, as he stated in his testimony;
it stops with me. I am the one who is ultimately accountable to the American
people. The admiral testified that he wanted to protect me; yet no President
should ever be protected from the truth. No operation is so secret that it must
be kept from the Commander in Chief. I had the right, the obligation, to make
my own decision. I heard someone the other day ask why I wasn't outraged. Well,
at times, I've been mad as a hornet. Anyone would be -- just look at the damage
that's been done and the time that's been lost. But I've always found that the
best therapy for outrage and anger is action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I've
tried to take steps so that what we've been through can't happen again, either
in this administration or future ones. But I remember very well what the Tower
board said last February when it issued this report. It said the failure was
more in people than in process. We can build in every precaution known to the
world. We can design that best system ever devised by man. But in the end,
people are going to have to run it. And we will never be free of human hopes,
weaknesses, and enthusiasms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
me tell you what I've done to change both the system and the people who operate
it. First of all, I've brought in a new and knowledgeable team. I have a new
National Security Adviser, a new Director of the CIA, a new Chief of Staff here
at the White House. And I've told them that I must be informed and informed
fully. In addition, I adopted the Tower board's model of how the NSC process
and staff should work, and I prohibited any operational role by the NSC staff
in covert activities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
report I ordered reviewing our nation's covert operations has been completed.
There were no surprises. Some operations were continued, and some were
eliminated because they'd outlived their usefulness. I am also adopting new,
tighter procedures on consulting with and notifying the Congress on future
covert action findings. We will still pursue covert operations when
appropriate, but each operation must be legal, and it must meet a specific
policy objective.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
problem goes deeper, however, than policies and personnel. Probably the biggest
lesson we can draw from the hearings is that the executive and legislative
branches of government need to regain trust in each other. We've seen the
results of that mistrust in the form of lies, leaks, divisions, and mistakes.
We need to find a way to cooperate while realizing foreign policy can't be run
by committee. And I believe there's now the growing sense that we can accomplish
more by cooperating. And in the end, this may be the eventual blessing in
disguise to come out of the Iran-contra mess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
now let me turn to the other subject I promised to discuss this evening -- the
future. There are now 17 months left in this administration, and I want them to
be prosperous, productive ones for the American people. When you first elected
me to this office, you elected me to pursue a new, different direction for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. When you elected me
the second time, you reaffirmed your desire to continue that course. My hopes
for this country are as fervent today as they were in 1981. Up until the
morning I leave this house, I intend to do what you sent me here to do -- lead
the Nation toward the goals we agreed on when you elected me. Let me tell you
where I'm going to put my heart and my energies for the remainder of my term.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
my entire political life, I've spoken about the need for the Supreme Court to
interpret the law, not make it. During my Presidency, I've proudly appointed
two new justices who understand that important principle -- Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor and Justice <span class=SpellE>Antonin</span> <span class=SpellE>Scalia</span>.
I've now nominated a third -- Judge Robert Bork. When I named him to the U.S.
Court of Appeals, the American Bar Association gave Judge Bork, who is a
brilliant scholar and jurist, its very highest rating. As a member of that
court, Judge Bork has written more than a hundred majority opinions and joined
in another 300. The Supreme Court has never reversed a single one of these 400
opinions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
nomination is being opposed by some because he practices judicial restraint.
Now, that means he won't put their opinions ahead of the law; he won't put his
own opinions ahead of the law. And that's the way it should be. Judge Bork
would be an important intellectual addition to the Court, and I will fight for
him because I believe in what he stands for. As soon as the Senate returns from
its recess next month, it should consider Judge Bork's qualifications and then
vote yes or no, up or down. This nation and its citizens deserve a full bench
with nine Justices when the Court convenes in October.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the months ahead, I also hope to reach an agreement, a comprehensive and
verifiable agreement, with the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
 font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> on reducing nuclear
arms. We're making real progress on the global elimination of an entire class
of nuclear weapons -- the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and Soviet
intermediate-range, or INF, missiles. I first proposed this idea to the Soviets
back in 1981. They weren't too keen on it and, in fact, walked out of the
negotiations at one point. But we kept at it. Until recently, the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> had insisted on the
right to retain some of its INF missiles. But in mid-July, General Secretary
Gorbachev announced that he was prepared to drop this demand. That was welcome
news, indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We've
come this far because in 1980 you gave me a mandate to rebuild our military.
I've done that. And today we're seeing the results. The Soviets are now
negotiating with us because we're negotiating from strength. This would be an
historic agreement. Previous arms control agreements merely put a ceiling on
weapons and even allowed for increases; this agreement would reduce the number
of nuclear weapons. I am optimistic that we'll soon witness a first in world
history -- the sight of two countries actually destroying nuclear weapons in
their arsenals. And imagine where that might lead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We're
also ready to move ahead on a START agreement that would cut intercontinental
nuclear forces by 50 percent, thereby <span class=GramE>eliminating</span>
thousands of nuclear missiles. I urge the Soviets to move ahead with us. And I
say to General Secretary Gorbachev, both our nations could begin a new
relationship by signing comprehensive agreements to reduce nuclear and
conventional weapons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
we seek in our relationship with the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:
 12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> is peace and stability.

bringing stability to this troubled region remains one of the most important
goals of my Presidency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Over
the next 17 months, I'll also be advocating an Economic Bill of Rights for our
citizens. I believe the American people have a right to expect the Nation's
budget to be handled responsibly. Yet chaos reigns in the budgetary process.
For the past several months, there's been much debate about getting our fiscal
house in order, but the result once again has been inaction. The congressional
budget process is neither reliable nor credible; in short, it needs to be
fixed. We must face reality: The only force strong enough to stop this nation's
massive runaway budget is the Constitution. Only the Constitution -- the
document from which all government power flows, the document that provides our
moral authority as a nation -- only the Constitution can compel responsibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
desperately need the power of a constitutional amendment to help us balance the
budget. Over 70 percent of the American people want such an amendment. They
want the Federal Government to have what 44 State governments already have --
discipline. To get things moving, I am proposing tonight: If Congress agrees to
schedule an up-or-down vote this year on our balanced budget amendment, <span
class=GramE>then</span> I will agree to negotiate on every spending item in the
budget. If the Congress continues to oppose the wishes of the people by
avoiding a vote on our balanced budget amendment, the call for a constitutional
convention will grow louder. The prospect for a constitutional convention is
only two States away from approval, and one way or another, the will of the
people always prevails.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
there's another area that will occupy my time and my heart: the cause of
democracy. There are Americans still burning for freedom: Central Americans,
