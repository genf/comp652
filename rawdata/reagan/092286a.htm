the idea of worship,'' <span class=SpellE>Dag</span> <span class=SpellE>Hammarskjold</span>
once said about this room, ``devotion to something which is greater and higher
than we are ourselves.'' Well, it's just such devotion that gave birth to the
United Nations -- devotion to the dream of world peace and freedom, of human
rights and democratic self-determination, of a time when, in those ancient

the United Nations. For over 40 years this organization has provided an
international forum for harmonizing conflicting national interests and has made
a significant contribution in such fields as peacekeeping, humanitarian
assistance, and eradicating disease. And yet no one knows better than those in
this chamber how the noble ideals embodied in the charter have often remained
unfulfilled. This organization itself faces a critical hour -- that is usually
stated as a fiscal crisis. But we can turn this crisis into an opportunity. The
important reforms proposed by a group of experts can be a first step toward
restoring the organization's status and effectiveness. The issue, ultimately,
is not one of cash but of credibility. If all the members of this universal
organization decide to seize the moment and turn the rhetoric of reform into
reality, the future of the U.N. will be secure. And you have my word for it: My
country, which has always given the U.N. generous support, will continue to
play a leading role in the effort to achieve its noble purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

now been held. For over 15 hours Soviet and American delegations met; for about
5 hours General Secretary Gorbachev and I talked, alone. Our talks were frank.
The talks were also productive -- in a larger sense than even the documents
that were agreed. Mr. Gorbachev was blunt, and so was I. We came to realize
again the truth of the statement: Nations do not mistrust each other because
they are armed; they are armed because they mistrust each other. And I did not
hesitate to tell Mr. Gorbachev our view of the source of that mistrust: the </span><st1:place><span

impose its ideology and rule on others. So, we acknowledged the deep and
abiding differences between our systems of government, our views of history and
the future of mankind. But despite these differences, we resolved to work
together for real reductions in nuclear arms, as well as progress in other
areas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the 41st General Assembly of the United Nations: Today I want to report to
you on what has transpired since the summit, notably the important letter I
sent July 25th to Mr. Gorbachev. In that letter, I dealt with the important
issues of reducing nuclear arms, agreeing on strategic defenses, and limiting
nuclear testing. In addition to those issues, which concern the military
aspects of Soviet-American relations, I would also like to address other
essential steps toward peace: the resolution of political conflicts, the
strengthening of the international economy, and the protection of human rights.

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Recently,
after the arrest of a Soviet national and U.N. employee accused of espionage in
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

fabricated accusations and trumped-up charges. He was arrested and jailed in a
callous disregard of due process and numerous human rights conventions. In
effect, he was taken as a hostage -- even threatened with the death penalty.
Both individuals have now been remanded to their respective Ambassadors. But
this is only an interim step agreed to by the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

of its action. Misusing the United Nations for purposes of espionage does a
grave disservice to this organization. And the world expects better. It expects
contributions to the cause of peace that only the leaders of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>It
is for this reason that I wrote last summer to Mr. Gorbachev with new arms
control proposals. Before discussing the proposals, let us be clear about which
weapons are the most dangerous and threatening to peace. The threat does not
come from defensive systems, which are a shield against attack, but from
offensive weapons -- ballistic missiles that hurtle through space and can wreak
mass destruction on the surface of the Earth, especially the Soviet Union's
heavy, accurate ICBM's, with multiple warheads, which have no counterparts in
size or number in any other country. And that is why the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> has long urged radical,
equitable, verifiable reductions in these offensive systems. Note that I said
``reduction,'' for this is the real purpose of arms control -- not just to
codify the levels of today's arsenals, not just to channel their further
expansion, but to reduce them in ways that will reduce the danger of war.
Indeed, the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> believes the prospect
of a future without such weapons of mass destruction must be the ultimate goal
of arms control.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>I
am pleased to say that the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> has now embraced our
idea of radical reductions in offensive systems. At the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Geneva</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> summit last November,
we agreed to intensify work in this area. Since then the Soviets have made
detailed proposals which, while not acceptable to us, appear to represent a
serious effort. So, we continue to seek a 50-percent reduction of American and
Soviet arsenals, with the central focus on the reduction of ballistic missile
warheads. If the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
 "Trebuchet MS"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> wants only a lesser reduction, however, we are
prepared to consider it -- but as an interim measure. In other provisions as
well, we have sought to take account of Soviet concerns. So, there has been
movement. Similarly, in the area of intermediate-range nuclear forces, the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> seeks the total
elimination of such missiles on a global basis. Again, if the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> insists on pursuing
such a goal in stages, we are prepared to conclude an interim agreement without
delay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>All
this gives me hope. I can tell you the exchanges between our two sides this
summer could well have marked the beginning of a serious, productive
negotiation on arms reduction. The ice of the negotiating stalemate could break
if both sides intensify their effort in the new round of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Geneva</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> talks and if we keep
the promises we made to each other last November. For too long a time, however,
the Soviet response has been to downplay the need for offensive reductions.
When the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> began work on
technology to make offensive nuclear weapons someday obsolete, the Soviets
tried to make that the main issue -- as if the main danger to strategic
stability was a defense against missiles that is still on the drawing boards,
rather than the menacing ballistic missiles themselves that already exist in
excessive numbers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> recognizes that both
the offensive and defensive sides of the strategic equation must be addressed.
And we have gone far to meet Soviet concerns expressed about the potential
offensive use of strategic defensive systems. I have offered firm and concrete
assurances that our SDI could never be used to deploy weapons in space that can
cause mass destruction on Earth. I have pointed out that the radical reduction
we seek now in offensive arsenals would be additional insurance that SDI cannot
be used to support a first-strike strategy. And our preference from the
beginning has been to move forward cooperatively with the Soviets on strategic
defenses so that <span class=GramE>neither side will feel threatened and</span>
both can benefit from the strategic revolution that SDI represents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the antiballistic missile treaty -- in spite of clear evidence the Soviets are

agreement with them on research, development, testing, and deployment of
strategic defenses based on the following: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>First,
both sides would agree to confine themselves through 1991 to research,
development, and testing -- which is permitted by the ABM treaty -- to
determine whether advanced systems of strategic defense are technically
feasible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Second,
a new treaty signed now would provide that if, after 1991, either side should
decide to deploy such a system, that side would be obliged to offer a plan for
sharing the benefits of strategic defense and for eliminating offensive
ballistic missiles. And this plan would be negotiated over a 2-year period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>In
addition to our proposals on offensive reductions and strategic defense, we
have suggested new steps in another area: nuclear testing. Just as eliminating
all nuclear weapons is our long-term goal, so, too, is a total ban on nuclear
testing. But both must be approached with practical steps, for the reality is
that for now we still must rely on these weapons for the deterrence of war.
Thus, the safety and reliability of our deterrent are themselves critical to
peace. The </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

nuclear testing. First, we are ready to move forward on ratification of the
threshold test ban treaty and the treaty on peaceful nuclear explosions, once
agreement is reached on improved verification procedures. We have proposed new
ideas to make this possible. Second, upon ratification of those treaties, and
in association with a program to reduce and ultimately eliminate all nuclear
weapons, we're prepared to discuss ways to implement a step-by-step, parallel
program of limiting and ultimately ending nuclear testing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>These

practical, attainable progress in limiting nuclear testing. Just a few days

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>As
we move toward our goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, it is vital that we

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>But
we must remember from the experience of the 1970's that progress in arms
control cannot be divorced from regional political developments. As I said at
the beginning, political tensions cause the military competition, not the other
way around. But while the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> disagree over the root
causes of political tension, we do agree that regional conflicts could escalate
into global confrontation. Last year from this rostrum, I presented a formula
for peace which would apply to five critical regional conflicts that are
potential flashpoints for wider conflict. I pointed out how difficult it is for
the United States to accept Soviet assurances of peaceful intent when 126,000
Soviet troops prosecute a vicious war against the Afghan people; when 140,000
Soviet-backed Vietnamese soldiers wage war on the people of Cambodia; when
1,700 Soviet advisers and 2,500 Cuban combat troops are involved in military
planning and operations in Ethiopia; when 1,300 Soviet military advisers and
36,000 Cuban troops direct and participate in combat operations to prop up an
unpopular, repressive regime in Angola; when hundreds of millions of dollars in
Soviet arms and Soviet-bloc advisers help a dictatorial regime in Nicaragua try
to subvert and betray a popular revolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>The
danger inherent in these conflicts must be recognized. Marxist-Leninist regimes
tend to wage war as readily against their neighbors as they routinely do
against their own people. In fact, the internal and external wars often become
indistinguishable. In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Afghanistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, for example, the
puppet regime has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of
people from border areas. Can anyone doubt this will be done in classic
Communist style -- by force? Many will die to make it easier for the Soviets
and their satellite troops to intimidate </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

transgressions that make the risk of confrontation with democratic nations so
acute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>So,
once again, I propose a three-point peace process for the resolution of
regional conflicts: First, talks between the warring parties themselves,
without which an end to violence and national reconciliation are impossible;
second, discussions between the United States and Soviet Union -- not to impose
solutions but to support peace talks and eventually eliminate the supply of
arms and the proxy troops from abroad; and third, if the talks are successful,
joint efforts to welcome each country back into the world economy and the
community of nations that respect human rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

addition to regional disputes, the grave threat of terrorism also jeopardizes
the hopes for peace. No cause, no grievance, can justify it. Terrorism is

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Moving
to the economic realm -- how ironic it is that some continue to espouse such
ideas as a ``new international economic order'' based on state control when the
world is learning, as never before, that the freedom of the individual, not the
power of the state, is the key to economic dynamism and growth. Nations have
turned away from centralized management and government controls and toward the
incentives and rewards of the free market. They have invited their citizens to
develop their talents and abilities to the fullest and, in the process, to
provide jobs, to create wealth, to build social stability and foster faith in
the future for all. The economic summits of the industrial democracies have
paid tribute to these principles, as has the historic U.N. Special Session on </span><st1:place><span

African nations' call for reform, leading to greater reliance on their private

of the recent recovery in the world economy can be directly attributed to this
growth of economic freedom. And it is this trend that offers such hope for the

which in turn sparks the very sort of trade wars that plunged the world in the

of economic freedom just as economic freedom is the inseparable twin of
political freedom and democratic government. And it is here that we come to our
final category: human rights, the indispensable element for peace, freedom, and
prosperity. I note that Mr. Gorbachev has used in recent speeches the same
categories I have used here today: the military, the political, and the

for the individual, for the dignity of the human person -- those rights
outlined in the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- does not belong
in the realm of charity or humanitarian causes. Respect for human rights is not
social work; it is not merely an act of compassion. It is the first obligation
of government and the source of its legitimacy. It also is the foundation stone
in any structure of world peace. All through history, it has been the
dictatorships and the tyrannies that have surrendered first to the cult of
militarism and the pursuit of war. Countries based on the consent of the
governed, countries that recognize the <span class=GramE>unalienable</span>
rights of the individual, do not make war on each other. Peace is more than
just an absence of war. True peace is justice, true peace is freedom, and true

of the general and universal physical fear it had engendered, a fear of
destruction that had become almost unbearable. But he said, ``I decline to
accept the end of man. I believe that man will not merely endure, he will
prevail. He is immortal . . . because he has a soul, a spirit capable of
compassion and sacrifice and endurance.'' Faulkner spoke of ``the old verities
