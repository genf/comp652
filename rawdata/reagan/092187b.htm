come from every continent, every race, and most religions to this great hall of
hope, where in the name of peace we practice diplomacy. Now, diplomacy, of
course, is a subtle and nuanced craft, so much so that it's said that when one
of the most wily diplomats of the 19th century passed away other diplomats
asked, on reports of his death, ``What do you suppose the old fox meant by

has been much talk in the halls of this building about the right to
development. But more and more the evidence is clear that development is not
itself a right. It is the product of rights: the right to own property; the
right to buy and sell freely; the right to contract; the right to be free of
excessive taxation and regulation, of burdensome government. There have been
studies that determined that countries with low tax rates have greater growth
than those with high rates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, and described an
economy of the poor that bypasses crushing taxation and stifling regulation.
This informal economy, as the researchers call it, is the principal supplier of
many goods and services and often the only ladder for upward mobility. In the
capital city, it accounts for almost all public transportation and most street
markets. And the researchers concluded that, thanks to the informal economy,
``the poor can work, travel, and have a roof over their heads.'' They might have
added that, by becoming underground entrepreneurs themselves or by working for
them, the poor have become less poor and the nation itself richer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who advocate <span class=SpellE>statist</span> solutions to development should
take note: The free market is the other path to development and the one true
path. And unlike many other paths, it leads somewhere. It works. So, this is
where I believe we can find the map to the world's future: in the hearts of
ordinary people, in their hopes for themselves and their children, in their
prayers as they lay themselves and their families to rest each night. These
simple people are the giants of the Earth, the true builders of the world and
shapers of the centuries to come. And if indeed they triumph, as I believe they
will, we will at last know a world of peace and freedom, opportunity and hope,
and, yes, of democracy -- a world in which the spirit of mankind at last
conquers the old, familiar enemies of famine, disease, tyranny, and war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

intellectual liberty in all its dimensions. We hope, for the sake of the
peoples of the U.S.S.R., that such changes will come. And we hope, for the sake
of peace, that it will include a foreign policy that respects the freedom and
independence of other peoples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
place should be better suited for discussions of peace than this hall. The
first Secretary-General, <span class=SpellE>Trygve</span> Lie, said of the
United Nations: ``With the danger of fire, and in the absence of an organized
fire department, it is only common sense for the neighbors to join in setting
up their own fire brigades.'' Joining together to drown the flames of war --
this, together with a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was the founding
ideal of the United Nations. It is our continuing challenge to ensure that the
U.N. lives up to these hopes. As the Secretary-General noted some time ago, the
risk of anarchy in the world has increased, because the fundamental rules of
the U.N. Charter have been violated. The General Assembly has repeatedly
acknowledged this with regard to the occupation of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Afghanistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. The charter has a
concrete practical meaning today, because it touches on all the dimensions of
human aspiration that I mentioned earlier -- the yearning for democracy and
freedom, for global peace, and for prosperity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is why we must protect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from being
debased as it was through the infamous ``Zionism is Racism'' resolution. We
cannot permit attempts to control the media and promote censorship under the
ruse of a so-called ``New World Information Order.'' We must work against
efforts to introduce contentious and <span class=SpellE>nonrelevant</span>
issues into the work of the specialized and technical agencies, where we seek
progress on urgent problems -- from terrorism to drug trafficking to nuclear proliferation
-- which threaten us all. Such efforts corrupt the charter and weaken this
organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

restoring its contribution as reforms progress. But there is still much to do.
The United Nations was built on great dreams and great ideals. Sometimes it has
strayed. It is time for it to come home. It was <span class=SpellE>Dag</span> <span
class=SpellE>Hammarskjold</span> who said: ``<span class=GramE>The</span> end
of all political effort must be the well-being of the individual in a life of
safety and freedom.'' Well, should this not be our credo in the years ahead?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have spoken today of a vision and the obstacles to its realization. More than a
century ago a young Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, visited </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. After that visit he
predicted that the two great powers of the future world would be, on one hand,
the United States, which would be built, as he said, ``by the plowshare,'' and,
on the other, Russia, which would go forward, again, as he said, ``by the
sword.'' Yet need it be so? Cannot swords be turned to plowshares? Can we and
all nations not live in peace? In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment,
we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we need
some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I
occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we
were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet, I ask you, is not
an alien force already among us? What could be more alien to the universal
aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of war?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
