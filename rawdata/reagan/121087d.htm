<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Good
evening. As I am speaking to you now, General Secretary Gorbachev is leaving on
his return trip to the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
 font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. His departure marks

  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> in which Mr. Gorbachev
and I continued to build a foundation for better relations between our
governments and our peoples. During these 3 days we took a step -- only a first
step, but still a critical one -- toward building a more durable peace, indeed,
a step that may be the most important taken since World War II to slow down the
arms buildup.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'm
referring to the treaty that we signed Tuesday afternoon in the East Room of
the White House. I believe this treaty represents a landmark in postwar
history, because it is not just an arms control but an arms reduction
agreement. Unlike treaties of the past, this agreement does not simply
establish ceilings for new weapons: It actually reduces the number of such
weapons. In fact, it altogether abolishes an entire class of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and Soviet nuclear
missiles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
verification measures in this treaty are also something new with far-reaching
implications. On-site inspections and short-notice inspections will be
permitted within the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
 font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. Again, this is a
first-time event, a breakthrough, and that's why I believe this treaty will not
only lessen the threat of war, it can also speed along a process that may
someday remove that threat entirely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indeed,
this treaty, and all that we've achieved during this summit, signals a broader
understanding between the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. It is an understanding
that will help keep the peace as we work toward the ultimate goal of our
foreign policy: a world where the people of every land can decide for
themselves their form of government and way of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
as important as the INF treaty is, there is a further and even more crucial
point about the last 3 days and the entire summit process: Soviet-American
relations are no longer focused only on arms control issues. They now cover a
far broader agenda, one that has, at its root, realism and candor. Let me
explain this with a saying I've often repeated: Nations do not distrust each
other because they're armed; they are armed because they distrust each other.
And just as real peace means the presence of freedom and justice as well as the
absence of war, so, too, summits must be discussions not just about arms but
about the fundamental differences that cause nations to be armed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dealing
then with the deeper sources of conflict between nations and systems of
government is a practical and moral imperative. And that's why it was vital to
establish a broader summit agenda, one that dealt not only with arms reductions
but also people-to-people contacts between our nations and, most important, the
issues of human rights and regional conflicts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is the summit agenda we've adopted. By doing so, we've dealt not just with arms
control issues but also with fundamental problems such as Soviet expansionism,
human rights violations, as well as our own moral opposition to the ideology
that justifies such practices. In this way, we have put Soviet-American
relations on a far more candid and far more realistic footing. It also means
that, while there's movement -- indeed, dramatic movement -- in the arms
reduction area, <span class=GramE>much</span> remains to be done in that area
as well as in these other critical areas that I've mentioned, especially -- and
this goes without saying -- in advancing our goal of a world open to the
expansion of human freedom and the growth of democratic government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
much work lies ahead. Let me explain: On the matter of regional conflicts, I
spoke candidly with Mr. Gorbachev on the issues of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Afghanistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, </span><st1:place><st1:City><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Iran-Iraq</span></st1:City><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, </span><st1:country-region><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Cambodia</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Angola</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nicaragua</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. I continue to have
high hopes -- and he assured me that he did too -- that we can have real
cooperation in resolving regional conflicts on terms that promote peace and
freedom. This is essential to a lasting improvement in our relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
too, on human rights, there was some very limited movement: resolution of a
number of individual cases in which prisoners will be released or exit visas
granted. There were assurances of future, more substantial movement, which we
hope to see become a reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
finally, with regard to the last item on our agenda -- scientific, educational,
cultural, and economic exchanges -- we agreed to expand cooperation in ways
that will break down some of the artificial barriers between our nations. For
example, agreement was reached to expand and improve civil air service between
our two countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
let me point out here that, while much work is ahead of us, the progress we've
made, especially in arms <span class=GramE>reduction,</span> does reflect a
better understanding between ourselves and the Soviets. It also reflects
something deeper. You see, since my first meeting with General Secretary
Gorbachev in 1985, I have always regarded you, the American people, as full
participants in our discussions. Though it may surprise Mr. Gorbachev to
discover that all this time there has been a third party in the room with us, I
do firmly believe the principal credit for the patience and persistence that
brought success this year belongs to you, the American people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

demands that we trade away SDI, our Strategic Defense Initiative that could

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
short, your support for our foreign policy goals -- building a safer peace as
we advance the cause of world freedom -- has helped bring the Soviets to the

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
know, the question has often been asked whether democratic leaders who are
accountable to their people aren't at a grave disadvantage in negotiating with
leaders of totalitarian States who bear no such burden. Well, believe <span
class=GramE>me,</span> I think I can answer that question. I can speak from
personal experience. Over the long run, no leader at the bargaining table can
enjoy any greater advantage than the knowledge that he has behind him a people
who are strong and free and alert and resolved to remain that way -- people
like you. And it's this kind of informed and enlightened support, this hidden
strength of democratic <span class=GramE>government, that</span> enabled us to

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
that the treaty's been signed, it will be submitted to the Senate for the next
step: the ratification process. I will meet with the leadership of Congress here
tomorrow morning, and I'm confident that the Senate will now act in an
expeditious way to fulfill its duty under our Constitution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
this end, let me explain the background. In the mid- and late-1970's the
Soviets began to deploy hundreds of new, mobile intermediate-range missiles
capable of destroying major cities and military installations in </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Asia</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. This action was an
unprovoked, new dimension of the threat against our friends and allies on both
continents, a new threat to which the democratic nations had no comparable
counter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite
intense pressure from the Soviets, NATO proceeded with what we called a
two-track policy. First, we would deploy a limited number of our own INF
missiles as a deterrent, but at the same time push hard in negotiations to do
away with this entirely new nuclear threat. And we set out to do this with a
formula I first put forward in 1981. It was called the zero-option. It meant
the complete elimination of these missiles on both sides. Well, at first, many called
this a mere propaganda ploy, some even here in this country. But we were
persistent, our allies steadfast, and eventually the Soviets returned to the
bargaining table. The result is our INF treaty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
you see from the map on the screen now, the Soviet missiles, which will be
removed and eliminated under the treaty, have been a major threat to the
security of our friends and allies on two continents, </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Asia</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. Under the terms of
this treaty, we will be eliminating 400 deployed warheads, while the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> eliminates 1,600, or
four times as many. Now, let me also point out that this does not, however,
leave NATO unprotected. In fact, we will maintain a substantial deterrent force
on the ground, in the air, and at sea. Our commitment to NATO's strategy of

with regard to verification, as I've mentioned, we have the breakthroughs of
on-site inspections and short-notice inspections not only at potential missile
deployment sites but at the facility where the Soviet SS - 20 missiles and
their components have been assembled. We have a verification procedure that
assures each side that the missiles of the other side have been destroyed and
that new ones aren't built. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

then, is a treaty that shows how persistence and consistency eventually can pay
off in arms negotiations. And let me assure you, too, that this treaty has been
accomplished with unprecedented consultation with our allies and friends. I
have spoken personally with the leaders of the major democracies, as has
Secretary Shultz and our diplomats. This treaty has full allied support. But if
persistence is paying off in our arms reduction efforts, the question of human
rights and regional conflicts are still problems in our relations. But I am
pleased that some progress has been made in these areas, also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

50-percent cuts in our arsenals of those powerful weapons. We agreed that we
should build on our efforts to achieve agreement on a START treaty at the
earliest possible date, and we've instructed our delegations in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
I believe deep reductions in these offensive weapons, along with the
development of SDI, would do much to make the world safer. For that reason, I
made it clear that our SDI program will continue and that when we have a
defense ready to deploy we will do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>About
the future, Mr. Gorbachev and I also agreed that as nuclear weapons are reduced
it becomes all the more important to redress the disparities in conventional
and chemical weapons, where the Soviets now enjoy significant advantages over
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:"Times New Roman"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and our allies. I think
then from all of this you can see not only the direction of Soviet-American
relations but the larger framework of American foreign policy. As I told the
British Parliament in 1982, we seek to rid the world of the two great
nightmares of the postwar era: the threat of nuclear war and the threat of
totalitarianism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
that's why, by pursuing SDI, which is a defense against offensive missiles, and
by going for arms reduction rather than just arms control, we're moving away
from the so-called policy of mutual assured destruction, by which nations hold
each other hostage to nuclear terror and destruction. So, too, we are saying
that the postwar policy of containment is no longer enough, that the goal of American
foreign policy is both world peace and world freedom, that as a people we hope
and will work for a day when all of God's children will enjoy the human dignity
that their creator intended. I believe we gained some ground with regard to
that cause in these last few days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> someday to take
vengeance on the man who had sent his mother to her death. But at the end of
the story, Nicholas Gage finds he cannot extract the vengeance he promised
himself. Mr. Gage writes it would have relieved the pain that had filled him
for so many years, but it would also have broken the one bridge still
connecting him to his mother, that part of him most like her. As he tells it: `<span

an invocation of what she'd died for -- a declaration of love.'' These simple
last words of Mr. Gage's mother, of <span class=SpellE>Eleni</span>, were: ``<span

that cry echoes down through the centuries, a cry for all children of the
world, a cry for peace, for a world of love and understanding. And it is the
hope of heeding such words -- the call for freedom and peace spoken by a chosen
people in a promised land, the call spoken by the <span class=SpellE>Nazar</span>
carpenter -- Nazarene carpenter, I should say, standing at the Sea of Galilee,
the carpenter whose birth into the poverty of a stable we celebrate -- it is

So, during this holy season, let us also reflect that in the prayers of simple
people there is more power and might than that possessed by all the great
statesmen or armies of the Earth. Let us then thank God for all His blessings
to this nation, and ask Him for His help and guidance so that we might continue
