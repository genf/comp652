Lord Mayor, Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, my Lords, aldermen, sheriffs,
ladies and gentlemen, I wonder if you can imagine what it is for an American to
stand in this place. Back in the States, we're terribly proud of anything more
than a few hundred years old; some even see my election to the Presidency as </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Guildhall
has been here since the 15th century, and while it is comforting at my age to
be near anything that much older than myself -- [laughter] -- the venerable age
of this institution is hardly all that impresses. Who can come here and not
think upon the moments these walls have seen, the many times that people of
this city and nation have gathered here in national crisis or national triumph?
In the darkest hours of the last World War, when the tense drama of Edward R. <span
class=SpellE>Murrow's</span> opening, ``This is London,'' was enough to impress
on millions of Americans the mettle of the British people, how many times in
those days did proceedings continue here, a testimony to the cause of
civilization for which you stood? From the </span><st1:place><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, you have in this
century so often remained steadfast for what is right -- and against what is
wrong. You are a brave people, and this land truly is, as your majestic, moving
hymn proclaims, a ``land of hope and glory.'' And it's why Nancy and I, in the
closing days of this historic trip, are glad to be in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> once again. After a
long journey, we feel among <span class=GramE>friends,</span> and with all our
hearts we thank you for having us here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such
feelings are, of course, especially appropriate to this occasion; I have come
from </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
  "Times New Roman"'>Moscow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> has been critical to
NATO's success and the cause of freedom. This hardly means that we've always
had a perfect understanding. When I first visited Mrs. Thatcher at the British
Embassy in 1981, she mischievously reminded me that the huge portrait
dominating the grand staircase was none other than that of George III, though
she did graciously concede that today most of her countrymen would agree with </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jefferson</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> that a little rebellion
now and then is a good thing. [Laughter] So, there has always been, as there
should be among friends, an element of fun about our differences. But let me
assure you, it is how much we have in common and the depth of our friendship
that truly matters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have often mentioned this in the States, but I have never had an opportunity to
tell a British audience how, during my first visit here 40 years ago, I was,
like most Americans, anxious to see some of the sights and those 400-year-old
inns I had been told abound in this country. Well, a driver took me and a couple
of other people to an old inn, a pub really -- and what in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> we would call a ``mom
and pop'' place. This quite elderly lady was waiting on us, and finally,
hearing us talk to one another, she said, ``<span class=GramE>You're</span>
Americans, aren't you?'' And we said we were. ``Oh,'' she said, ``there were a
lot of your chaps stationed down the road during the war.'' And she added, ``<span
class=GramE>They</span> used to come in here of an evening, and they'd have a
songfest. They called me mom, and they called the old man pop.'' And then her
mood changed, and she said, ``It was Christmas Eve, and you know, we were all
alone and feeling a bit down. And suddenly they burst through the door, and
they had presents for me and Pop.'' And by this time she wasn't looking at us
anymore; she was looking off into the distance, into memory, and there were
tears in her eyes. And then she said, ``Big strapping lads they was, from a
place called <span class=SpellE>Ioway</span>.'' [Laughter]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and Dorset -- all of them caught up in the terrible paradoxes of that time:
that young men must wage war to end war, and die for freedom so that freedom
itself might live. And it is those same two causes for which they fought and
died -- the cause of peace, the cause of freedom for all humanity -- that still
brings us, British and American, together. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, and other allied
nations have for 44 years made enormous sacrifices to keep our alliance strong
and our military ready. For them we embarked in this decade on a new postwar
strategy, a forward strategy of freedom, a strategy of public candor about the
moral and fundamental differences between <span class=SpellE>statism</span> and
democracy, but also a strategy of vigorous diplomatic engagement; a policy that
rejects both the inevitability of war or the permanence of totalitarian rule, a
policy based on realism that seeks not just treaties for treaties' sake but the
recognition and resolution of fundamental differences with our adversaries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
pursuit of this policy has just now taken me to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Moscow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, and, let me say, I
believe this policy is bearing fruit. Quite possibly, we're beginning to take
down the barriers of the postwar era; quite possibly, we are entering a new era
in history, a time of lasting change in the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. We will have to see.
But if so, it's because of the steadfastness of the allies -- the democracies
-- for more than 40 years, and especially in this decade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
history of our time will undoubtedly include a footnote about how, during this
decade and the last, the voice of retreat and hopelessness reached a crescendo
in the West -- insisting the only way to peace was unilateral disarmament,
proposing nuclear freezes, opposing deployment of counterbalancing weapons such
as intermediate-range missiles or the more recent concept of strategic defense
systems. These same voices ridiculed the notion of going beyond arms control,
the hope of doing something more than merely establishing artificial limits
within which arms buildups could continue all but unabated. Arms reduction
would never work, they said, and when the Soviets left the negotiating table in
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Geneva</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

proclaimed disaster. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
yet it was our double-zero option, much maligned when first proposed, that
provided the basis for the INF treaty, the first treaty ever that did not just
control offensive weapons but reduced them and, yes, actually eliminated an
entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles. This treaty, last month's
development in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Afghanistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, the changes we see in

 Union</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
-- these are momentous events; not conclusive, but momentous. And that's why,
although history will duly note that we, too, heard voices of denial and doubt,
it is those who spoke with hope and strength who will be best remembered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
here I want to say that through all the troubles of the last decade, one such
firm, eloquent voice, a voice that proclaimed proudly the cause of the Western
alliance and human <span class=GramE>freedom,</span> has been heard. A voice
that never sacrificed its anticommunist credentials or its realistic appraisal
of change in the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
 "Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, but because it came from the longest-serving
leader in the alliance, it did become one of the first to suggest that we could
``do business'' with Mr. Gorbachev. So, let me discharge my first official duty
here today. Prime Minister, the achievements of the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> summits say much about
your valor and strength and, by virtue of the office you hold, that of the
British people. So let me say, simply: At this hour in history, Prime Minister,
the entire world salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
while your leadership and the vision of the British people have been an
inspiration, not just to my own people but to all of those who love freedom and
yearn for peace, I know you join me in a deep sense of gratitude toward the
leaders and peoples of all the democratic allies. Whether deploying crucial
weapons of deterrence, standing fast in the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Persian Gulf</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, combating terrorism
and aggression by outlaw regimes, or helping freedom fighters around the globe,
rarely in history has any alliance of free nations acted with such firmness and
dispatch, and on so many <span class=GramE>fronts.</span> In a process reaching
back as far as the founding of NATO and the Common Market, the House of Western
Europe, together with the United States, Canada, Japan, and others -- this
House of Democracy -- engaged in an active diplomacy while sparking a startling
growth of democratic institutions and free markets all across the globe; in
short, an expansion of the frontiers of freedom and a lessening of the chances
of war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is within this context that I report now on events in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

class=GramE>time</span>, Mr. Gorbachev and I exchanged the instruments of
ratification of the INF treaty. So, too, we made tangible progress toward the
START treaty on strategic weapons. Such a treaty, with all its implications,
is, I believe, now within our grasp. But part of the realism and candor we were
determined to bring to negotiations with the Soviets meant refusing to put all
the weight of these negotiations and our bilateral relationship on the single
issue of arms control. As I never tire of saying, nations do not distrust each
other because they are armed; they are armed because they distrust each other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
equally important items on the agenda dealt with critical issues, like regional
conflicts, human rights, and bilateral exchanges. With regard to regional
conflicts, here, too, we are now in the third week of the pullout of Soviet
troops from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. The importance of this
step should not be underestimated. Our third area of discussion was bilateral
contacts between our peoples, an expanding program of student exchanges and the
opening of cultural centers -- progress toward a broader understanding of each
other. And finally, on the issue of human rights -- granting people the right
to speak, write, travel, and worship freely -- there are signs of greater
individual freedom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

originally I was going to give you just an accounting on these items. But, you
know, on my first day in Moscow Mr. Gorbachev used a Russian saying: ``Better
to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.'' So, if I might
go beyond our four-part agenda today and offer just a moment or two of personal
reflection on the country I saw for the first time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
all aspects of Soviet life, the talk is of progress toward democratic reform --
in the economy, in political institutions, in religious, social, and artistic
life. It is called glasnost -- openness; it is perestroika -- restructuring.
Mr. Gorbachev and I discussed his upcoming party conference, where many of
these reforms will be debated and perhaps adopted -- such things as official
accountability, limitations on length of service in office, an independent
judiciary, revisions of the criminal law, and lowering taxes on cooperatives. <span

to control their own destinies.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

how much our people have in common. It was a special moment in a week of
special moments. My personal impression of Mr. Gorbachev is that he is a

heart of postwar tensions and conflicts. No, disputes among governments over
the pursuit of <span class=SpellE>statism</span> and expansionism have been the
central point in our difficulties. Now that the allies are strong and
expansionism is receding around the world and in the </span><st1:place><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, there is hope. And we
look for this trend to continue. We must do all we can to assist it. And this
means openly acknowledging positive change and crediting it. But let us also
remember the strategy that we have adopted is one that provides for setbacks
along the way as well as progress. Let us embrace honest change when it occurs.
But let us also be wary; let us stay strong; and let us be confident, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prime
Minister, perhaps you remember that upon accepting your gracious invitation to
address the members of the Parliament in 1982, I suggested then that the world
could well <span class=GramE>be</span> at a turning point when the two great
threats to life in this century -- nuclear war and totalitarian rule -- might
now be overcome. In an accounting of what might lie ahead for the Western
alliance, I suggested that the hard evidence of the totalitarian experiment was
now in and that this evidence had led to an uprising of the intellect and will,
one that reaffirmed the dignity of the individual in the face of the modern
state. I suggested, too, that in a way Marx was right when he said the
political order would come into conflict with the economic order; only he was
wrong in predicting which part of the world this would occur in, for the crisis
came not in the Capitalist West but in the Communist East. Noting the economic
difficulties reaching the critical stage in the </span><st1:place><span

 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Eastern Europe</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, I said that at other
times in history the ruling elites had faced such situations and, when they
encountered resolve and determination from free nations, decided to loosen
their grip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was then I suggested that the tides of history were running in the cause of
liberty, but only if we, as free men and women, joined together in a worldwide
movement toward democracy, a crusade for freedom, a crusade that would be not
so much a struggle of armed might, not so much a test of bombs and rockets, as
a test of faith and will. Well, that crusade for freedom, that crusade for
peace is well underway. We have found the will. We have held fast to the faith.
And, whatever happens, whatever triumphs or disappointments ahead, we must keep
to this strategy of strength and candor, this strategy of hope -- hope in the
eventual triumph of freedom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
as we move forward, let us not fail to note the lessons we've learned along the
way in developing our strategy. We have learned the first objective of the
adversaries of freedom is to make free nations question their own faith in
freedom, to make us think that adhering to our principles and speaking out
against human rights abuses or foreign aggression is somehow an act of
belligerence. Well, over the long run, such inhibitions make free peoples
silent and, ultimately, half-hearted about their cause. This is the first and
most important defeat free nations can ever suffer, for when free peoples cease
telling the truth about and to their adversaries, they cease telling the truth
to themselves. In matters of state, unless the truth <span class=GramE>be</span>
spoken, it ceases to exist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is in this sense that the best indicator of how much we care about freedom is
what we say about freedom; it is in this sense that words truly are actions.
And there is one added and quite extraordinary benefit to this sort of realism
and public candor: This is also the best way to avoid war or conflict. Too
often in the past, the adversaries of freedom forgot the reserves of strength
and resolve among free peoples; too often they interpreted conciliatory words
as weakness; and too often they miscalculated and underestimated the
willingness of free men and women to resist to the end. Words of freedom remind
them otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

General John Frost, a bluff Briton who had committed the battalion that held

story mentioned the wife of Cornelius Ryan, the American writer who
immortalized Market Garden in his book, ``A Bridge Too Far,'' who told the
reporter that just as Mr. Ryan was finishing his book -- writing the final
paragraphs about General Frost's valiant stand at <span class=SpellE>Arnhem</span>
and about how in his eyes his men would always be undefeated -- her husband
burst into tears. That was quite unlike him; and Mrs. Ryan, alarmed, rushed to
him. The writer could only look up and say of General Frost: ``<span

there in <span class=SpellE>Spaso</span> House with Soviet dissidents, I had

this quote from General Frost about his visits to that bridge. ```We've been

is such a pilgrimage and that our Maker, while never denying us free will, does
over time guide us with a wise and provident hand, giving direction to history

civilized ideas that comprise so much of your heritage: the development of law
embodied by your constitutional tradition, the idea of restraint on centralized
power and individual rights as established in your Magna <span class=SpellE>Carta</span>,
the idea of representative government as embodied by the mother of all
parliaments. But we go beyond even this. Your own Evelyn Waugh, who reminded us
that ``civilization -- and by this I do not mean talking cinemas and tinned
food nor even surgery and hygienic houses but the whole moral and artistic
organization of Europe -- has not in itself the power of survival.'' It came
into being, he said, through the Judeo-Christian tradition and ``without it has
no significance or power to command allegiance. It is no longer possible,'' he
wrote, ``to accept the benefits of civilization and at the same time deny the
supernatural basis on which it rests.''<o:p></o:p></span></p>

so, it is first things we must consider. And here it is, a story, one last <span

story that a few years ago came in the guise of that art form for which I have
an understandable affection -- the cinema. It's a story about the 1920 Olympics

come from distant lands and found freedom and refuge here in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

young Scotsman, who would not sacrifice religious conviction for fame. In one
unforgettable scene, Eric Liddell reads the words of Isaiah. ``He <span
