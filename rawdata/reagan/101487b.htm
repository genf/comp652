for the Supreme Court. You've heard that this nomination is a lost cause.
You've also heard that I am determined to fight right down to the final ballot
on the Senate floor. I'm doing this because what's now at stake in this battle
must never in our land of freedom become a lost cause. And whether lost or not,
we Americans must never give up this particular battle: the independence of our
judiciary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Back
in July when I nominated Judge Bork, I thought the confirmation process would
go forward with a calm and sensible exchange of views. Unfortunately, the
confirmation process became an ugly spectacle, marred by distortions and
innuendos, and casting aside the normal rules of decency and honesty. As Judge
Bork said last Friday, and I quote: ``The process of confirming Justices for
our nation's highest court has been transformed in a way that should not and,
indeed, must not be permitted to occur again. The tactics and techniques of
national political campaigns have been unleashed on the process of confirming
judges. That is not simply disturbing; it is dangerous. Federal judges are not
appointed to decide cases according to the latest opinion polls; they are
appointed to decide cases impartially, according to law. But when judicial
nominees are assessed and treated like political candidates, the effect will be
to chill the climate in which judicial deliberations take place, to erode
public confidence in the impartiality of courts, and to endanger the
independence of the judiciary.''<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Judge
Bork said he had no illusions about the difficulty of the task before us, but
he also said, and I agree, that a crucial principle is at stake. And we will
fight for every vote to maintain that principle. It is the process that is used
to determine the fitness of those men and women selected to serve on our
courts, those people who guard the basic liberties that we all cherish and have
been the beacon of freedom for over two centuries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the campaign of distortion and disinformation used by opponents of this nominee
is allowed to succeed, it will represent more than a temporary setback for one
candidate or the administration. It will permanently diminish the sum total of
American democracy; it will call into question the idea of free, fair, and
civil exchange; and it will mean that on critical issues like the fight against
crime and drugs and keeping those who are unelected from unconstitutionally
taking power into their own hands -- each of us and each of our children will
be the losers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the hearings, one of Judge Bork's critics said that among the functions of the
Court was reinterpreting the Constitution so that it would not remain, in his
words, ``frozen into ancient error because it is so hard to amend.'' Well, that
to my mind is the issue, plain and simple. Too many theorists believe that the
courts should save the country from the Constitution. Well, I believe it's time
to save the Constitution from them. The principal errors in recent years have
had nothing to do with the intent of the framers who finished their work 200
years ago last month. They've had to do with those who have looked upon the
courts as their own special province to impose by judicial fiat what they could
not accomplish at the polls. They've had to do with judges who too often have
made law enforcement a game where clever lawyers try to find ways to trip up
the police on the rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the local, State, and Federal levels, your voices have been heard. After years
of rising crime and leniency in the courtrooms, you demanded fair but tough law
enforcement, enforcement that protected the innocent and punished the guilty.
And with your support, we've been able to turn things around in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. We organized a war
against organized crime and a stepped-up effort against drug trafficking. It
took us 3 years, but we finally got our crime bill through the Congress. But
most of all, I kept a promise that I made to you when I ran for this office:
that from my first day here in the White House that I would seek to nominate
judges who would respect the Constitution and would protect the rights of those
who become victims of crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
all of this meant hard work, but together we have turned the crime trend
around. The Department of Justice just over a week ago released a study showing
that crime had declined for the fifth straight year and has now reached its
lowest level in 14 years. That's something to be proud of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
my agenda is your agenda, and it's quite simple: to appoint judges like Judge
Bork who don't confuse the criminals with the victims; judges who don't invent
new or fanciful constitutional rights for those criminals; judges who believe
the courts should interpret the law, not make it; judges, in short, who
understand the principle of judicial restraint. That starts with the Supreme
Court. It takes leadership from the Supreme Court to help shape the attitudes
of the courts in our land and to make sure <span class=GramE>that principles</span>
of law are based on the Constitution. That is the standard to judge those who
seek to serve on the courts: qualifications, not distortions; judicial
temperament, not campaign disinformation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the next several days, your Senators will cast a vote on the Bork nomination.
It is more than just one vote on one man: It's a decision on the future of our
judicial system. The purpose of the Senate debate is to allow all sides to be
heard. Honorable men and women should not be afraid to change their minds based
on that debate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
hope that in the days and weeks ahead you will let them know that the
confirmation process must never again be compromised with high-pressure
politics. Tell them that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. Remind them that there
is a thing we call the Constitution and to serve under it is a sacred trust,
that they have sworn themselves to that trust, and that not just for this
nomination or any nomination but for the sake of the independence of the
American system of justice for generations to come. Now is the time to uphold
that trust, no matter how powerful are those in opposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
