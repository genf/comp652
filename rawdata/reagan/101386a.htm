style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, General Secretary
Gorbachev. As I did last year when I returned from the summit conference in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Geneva</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, I want to take a few
moments tonight to share with you what took place in these discussions. The
implications of these talks are enormous and only just beginning to be understood.
We proposed the most sweeping and generous arms control proposal in history. We
offered the complete elimination of all ballistic missiles -- Soviet and
American -- from the face of the Earth by 1996. While we parted company with
this American offer still on the table, we are closer than ever before to
agreements that could lead to a safer world without nuclear weapons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>But
first, let me tell you that from the start of my meetings with Mr. Gorbachev, I
have always regarded you, the American people, as full participants. Believe
me, without your support none of these talks could have been held, nor could
the ultimate aims of American foreign policy -- world peace and freedom -- be
pursued. And it's for these aims I went the extra mile to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Iceland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. Before I report on our
talks, though, allow me to set the stage by explaining two things that were
very much a part of our talks: one a treaty and the other a defense against
nuclear missiles, which we're trying to develop. Now, you've heard their titles
a thousand times -- the ABM treaty and SDI. Well those letters stand for: ABM,
antiballistic missile; SDI, Strategic Defense Initiative. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Some
years ago, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to limit any defense
against nuclear missile attacks to the emplacement in one location in each
country of a small number of missiles capable of intercepting and shooting down
incoming nuclear missiles, thus leaving our real defense -- a policy called
mutual assured destruction, meaning if one side launched a nuclear attack, the
other side could retaliate. And this mutual threat of destruction was believed
to be a deterrent against either side striking first. So here we sit, with
thousands of nuclear warheads targeted on each other and capable of wiping out
both our countries. The Soviets deployed the few antiballistic missiles around </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Moscow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> as the treaty
permitted. Our country didn't bother deploying because the threat of nationwide
annihilation made such a limited defense seem useless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>For
some years now we've been aware that the Soviets may be developing a nationwide
defense. They have installed <span class=GramE>a large</span>, modern radar at </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Krasnoyarsk</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, which we believe is a
critical part of a radar system designed to provide radar guidance for
antiballistic missiles protecting the entire nation. Now, this is a violation
of the ABM treaty. Believing that a policy of mutual destruction and slaughter
of their citizens and ours was uncivilized, I asked our military, a few years
ago, to study and see if there was a practical way to destroy nuclear missiles
after their launch but before they can reach their targets, rather than to just
destroy people. Well, this is the goal for what we call SDI, and our scientists
researching such a system are convinced it is practical and that several years
down the road we can have such a system ready to deploy. Now incidentally, we
are not violating the ABM treaty, which permits such research. If and when we
deploy the treaty -- also allows withdrawal from the treaty upon 6 months'
notice. SDI, let me make it clear, is a <span class=SpellE>nonnuclear</span>
defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>So,
here we are at </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Iceland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> for our second such
meeting. In the first, and in the months in between, we have discussed ways to
reduce and in fact eliminate nuclear weapons entirely. We and the Soviets have
had teams of negotiators in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Geneva</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> trying to work out a
mutual agreement on how we could reduce or eliminate nuclear weapons. <span
class=GramE>And so far, no success.</span> On Saturday and Sunday, General
Secretary Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Shevardnadze, and Secretary of
State George Shultz and I met for nearly 10 hours. We didn't limit ourselves to
just arms reductions. We discussed what we call violation of human rights on
the part of the Soviets -- refusal to let people emigrate from Russia so they
can practice their religion without being persecuted, letting people go to
rejoin their families, husbands, and wives -- separated by national borders --
being allowed to reunite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>In
much of this, the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
 "Trebuchet MS"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> is violating another agreement -- the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Helsinki</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> accords they had signed
in 1975. <span class=SpellE>Yuriy</span> <span class=SpellE>Orlov</span>, whose
freedom we just obtained, was imprisoned for pointing out to his government its
violations of that pact, its refusal to let citizens leave their country or
return. We also discussed regional matters such as </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Afghanistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Cambodia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. But by their choice,
the main subject was arms control. We discussed the emplacement of
intermediate-range missiles in </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> and </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Asia</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> and seemed to be in
agreement they could be drastically reduced. Both sides seemed willing to find
a way to reduce, even to zero, the strategic ballistic missiles we have aimed
at each other. This then brought up the subject of SDI.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>I
offered a proposal that we continue our present research. And if and when we
reached the stage of testing, we would sign, now, a treaty that would permit
Soviet observation of such tests. And if the program was practical, we would
both eliminate our offensive missiles, and then we would share the benefits of
advanced defenses. I explained that even though we would have done away with
our offensive ballistic missiles, having the defense would protect against
cheating or the possibility of a madman, sometime, deciding to create nuclear
missiles. After all, the world now knows how to make them. I likened it to our
keeping our gas masks, even though the nations of the world had outlawed poison
gas after World War I. We seemed to be making progress on reducing weaponry,
although the General Secretary was registering opposition to SDI and proposing
a pledge to observe ABM for a number of years as the day was ending.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Secretary
Shultz suggested we turn over the notes our note-takers had been making of
everything we'd said to our respective teams and let them work through the
night to put them together and find just where we were in agreement and what
differences separated us. With respect and gratitude, I can inform you those
teams worked through the night till </span><st1:time Minute="30" Hour="6"><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>6:30 a.m.</span></st1:time><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> Yesterday, Sunday
morning, Mr. Gorbachev and I, with our foreign ministers, came together again
and took up the report of our two teams. It was most promising.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>The
Soviets had asked for a 10-year delay in the deployment of SDI programs. In an
effort to see how we could satisfy their concerns -- while protecting our
principles and security -- we proposed a 10-year period in which we began with
the reduction of all strategic nuclear arms, bombers, air-launched cruise
missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic
missiles and the weapons they carry. They would be reduced 50 percent in the
first 5 years. During the next 5 years, we would continue by eliminating all
remaining offensive ballistic missiles, of all ranges. And during that time, we
would proceed with research, development, and testing of SDI -- all done in conformity
with ABM provisions. At the 10-year point, with all ballistic missiles
eliminated, we could proceed to deploy advanced defenses, at the same time
permitting the Soviets to do likewise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>And
here the debate began. The General Secretary wanted wording that, in effect,
would have kept us from developing the SDI for the entire 10 years. In effect,
he was killing SDI. And unless I agreed, all that work toward eliminating
nuclear weapons would go down the drain -- canceled. I told him I had pledged
to the American people that I would not trade away SDI, there was no way I
could tell our people their government would not protect them against nuclear
destruction. I went to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Reykjavik</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> determined that
everything was negotiable except two things: our freedom and our future. I'm
still optimistic that a way will be found. The door is open, and the
opportunity to begin eliminating the nuclear threat is within reach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>So
you can see<span class=GramE>,</span> we made progress in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. And we will continue
to make progress if we pursue a prudent, deliberate, and above all, realistic
approach with the Soviets. From the earliest days of our administration this
has been our policy. We made it clear we had no illusions about the Soviets or
their ultimate intentions. We were publicly candid about the critical, moral
distinctions between totalitarianism and democracy. We declared the principal
objective of American foreign policy to be not just the prevention of war, but
the extension of freedom. And we stressed our commitment to the growth of democratic
government and democratic institutions around the world. And that's why we
assisted freedom fighters who are resisting the imposition of totalitarian rule
in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, and elsewhere. And
finally, we began work on what I believe most spurred the Soviets to negotiate
seriously: rebuilding our military strength, reconstructing our strategic
deterrence, and above all, beginning work on the Strategic Defense Initiative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>And
yet, at the same time, we set out these foreign policy goals and began working
toward them. We pursued another of our major objectives: that of seeking means
to lessen tensions with the Soviets and ways to prevent war and keep the peace.
Now, this policy is now paying dividends -- one sign of this in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Iceland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> was the progress on the
issue of arms control. For the first time in a long while, Soviet-American
negotiations in the area of arms reductions are moving, and moving in the right
direction -- not just toward arms control, but toward arms reduction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>But
for all the progress we made on arms reductions, we must remember there were
other issues on the table in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

fundamental. As I mentioned, one such issue is human rights. As President

made it plain, once again, that an improvement of the human condition within

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Another

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> also lies at the heart
of the differences between the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

 style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Southeast Asia</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. Until Soviet policies
change, we will make sure that our friends in these areas -- those who fight
for freedom and independence -- will have the support they need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Finally,
there was a fourth item. And this area was that of bilateral relations,
people-to-people contacts. In </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Geneva</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> last year, we welcomed

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, we saw indications of
more movement in these areas. But let me say now: The United States remains
committed to people-to-people programs that could lead to exchanges between not
just a few elite, but thousands of everyday citizens from both our countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>So,
I think, then, that you can see that we did make progress in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Iceland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> on a broad range of
topics. We reaffirmed our four-point agenda. We discovered major new grounds of
agreement. We probed again some old areas of disagreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>And
let me return again to the SDI issue. I realize some Americans may be asking
tonight: Why not accept Mr. Gorbachev's demand? Why not give up SDI for this
agreement? Well, the answer, my friends, is simple. SDI is </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>'s security guarantee if
the Soviets should -- as they have done too often in the past -- fail to comply
with their solemn commitments. SDI is what brought the Soviets back to arms

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. SDI is the key to a
world without nuclear weapons. The Soviets understand this. They have devoted
far more resources, for a lot longer time than we, to their own SDI. The
world's only operational missile defense today surrounds </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Moscow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>What
Mr. Gorbachev was demanding at </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

told him we don't make those kinds of deals in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. And the American
people should reflect on these critical questions: How does a defense of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> remain forever
vulnerable to Soviet rocket attack? As of today, all free nations are utterly
defenseless against Soviet missiles -- fired either by accident or design. Why
does the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Soviet
 Union</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>So,
my fellow Americans, I cannot promise, nor can any President promise, that the
talks in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Iceland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'> or any future
discussions with Mr. Gorbachev will lead inevitably to great breakthroughs or
momentous treaty signings. We will not abandon the guiding principle we took to
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Reykjavik</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. We prefer no agreement

  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. And on this point, I
know you're also interested in the question of whether there will be another
summit. There was no indication by Mr. Gorbachev as to when or whether he plans
to travel to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, as we agreed he would
last year in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Geneva</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>. I repeat tonight that
our invitation stands, and that we continue to believe additional meetings
would be useful. But that's a decision the Soviets must make. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>But
whatever the immediate prospects, I can tell you that I'm ultimately hopeful
about the prospects for progress at the summit and for world peace and freedom.
You see, the current summit process is very different from that of previous
decades. It's different because the world is different; and the world is
different because of the hard work and sacrifice of the American people during
the past 5\1/2\ years. Your energy has restored and expanded our economic
might. Your support has restored our military strength. Your courage and sense
of national unity in times of crisis have given pause to our adversaries,
heartened our friends, and inspired the world. The Western democracies and the
NATO alliance are revitalized; and all across the world, nations are turning to
democratic ideas and the principles of the free market. So, because the
American people stood guard at the critical hour, freedom has gathered its
forces, regained its strength, and is on the march. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>So,
if there's one impression I carry away with me from these October talks, it is
that, unlike the past, we're dealing now from a position of strength. And for
that reason, we have it within our grasp to move speedily with the Soviets
toward even more breakthroughs. Our ideas are out there on the table. They
won't go away. We're ready to pick up where we left off. Our negotiators are
heading back to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Geneva</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>, and we're prepared to
go forward whenever and wherever the Soviets are ready. So, there's reason,
good reason for hope. I saw evidence of this is in the progress we made in the
talks with Mr. Gorbachev. And I saw evidence of it when we left </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Trebuchet MS"'>Iceland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

to our young men and women at our naval installation at </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
