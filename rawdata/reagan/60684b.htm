<h2>Remarks at a United States-France Ceremony Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Normandy Invasion, D-day <p>

June 6, 1984</h2>

Mr. President, distinguished guests, we stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw
and felt the worst of war. Men bled and died here for a few feet of -- or inches of sand, as bullets
and shellfire cut through their ranks. About them, General Omar Bradley later said, ``Every man
who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero.''<p>

No speech can adequately portray their suffering, their sacrifice, their heroism. President Lincoln
once reminded us that through their deeds, the dead of battle have spoken more eloquently for
themselves than any of the living ever could. But we can only honor them by rededicating
ourselves to the cause for which they gave a last full measure of devotion.<p>

Today we do rededicate ourselves to that cause. And at this place of honor, we're humbled by the
realization of how much so many gave to the cause of freedom and to their fellow man.<p>

Some who survived the battle of June 6, 1944, are here today. Others who hoped to return never
did.<p>

``Someday, Lis, I'll go back,'' said Private First Class Peter Robert Zanatta, of the 37th Engineer
Combat Battalion, and first assault wave to hit Omaha Beach. ``I'll go back, and I'll see it all
again. I'll see the beach, the barricades, and the graves.''<p>

Those words of Private Zanatta come to us from his daughter, Lisa Zanatta Henn, in a
heart-rending story about the event her father spoke of so often. ``In his words, the Normandy
invasion would change his life forever,'' she said. She tells some of his stories of World War II but
says of her father, ``the story to end all stories was D-day.''<p>

``He made me feel the fear of being on that boat waiting to land. I can smell the ocean and feel the
seasickness. I can see the looks on his fellow soldiers' faces -- the fear, the anguish, the
uncertainty of what lay ahead. And when they landed, I can feel the strength and courage of the
men who took those first steps through the tide to what must have surely looked like instant
death.''<p>

Private Zanatta's daughter wrote to me: ``I don't know how or why I can feel this emptiness, this
fear, or this determination, but I do. Maybe it's the bond I had with my father. All I know is that it
brings tears to my eyes to think about my father as a 20-year-old boy having to face that
beach.''<p>

The anniversary of D-day was always special for her family. And like all the families of those who
went to war, she describes how she came to realize her own father's survival was a miracle: ``So
many men died. I know that my father watched many of his friends be killed. I know that he must
have died inside a little each time. But his explanation to me was, `You did what you had to do,
and you kept on going.'''<p>

When men like Private Zanatta and all our allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy 40
years ago they came not as conquerors, but as liberators. When these troops swept across the
French countryside and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to take, but to
return what had been wrongly seized. When our forces marched into Germany they came not to
prey on a brave and defeated people, but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those who
yearned to be free again.<p>

We salute them today. But, Mr. President, we also salute those who, like yourself, were already
engaging the enemy inside your beloved country -- the French Resistance. Your valiant struggle
for France did so much to cripple the enemy and spur the advance of the armies of liberation. The
French Forces of the Interior will forever personify courage and national spirit. They will be a
timeless inspiration to all who are free and to all who would be free.<p>

Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate the triumph of democracy. We
reaffirm the unity of democratic peoples who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in
a firm resolve to keep the peace.<p>

From a terrible war we learned that unity made us invincible; now, in peace, that same unity
makes us secure. We sought to bring all freedom-loving nations together in a community
dedicated to the defense and preservation of our sacred values. Our alliance, forged in the crucible
of war, tempered and shaped by the realities of the postwar world, has succeeded. In Europe, the
threat has been contained, the peace has been kept.<p>

Today the living here assembled -- officials, veterans, citizens -- are a tribute to what was
achieved here 40 years ago. This land is secure. We are free. These things are worth fighting and
dying for.<p>

Lisa Zanatta Henn began her story by quoting her father, who promised that he would return to
Normandy. She ended with a promise to her father, who died 8 years ago of cancer: ``I'm going
there, Dad, and I'll see the beaches and the barricades and the monuments. I'll see the graves, and
I'll put flowers there just like you wanted to do. I'll feel all the things you made me feel through
your stories and your eyes. I'll never forget what you went through, Dad, nor will I let anyone else
forget. And, Dad, I'll always be proud.''<p>

Through the words of his loving daughter, who is here with us today, a D-day veteran has shown
us the meaning of this day far better than any President can. It is enough for us to say about
Private Zanatta and all the men of honor and courage who fought beside him four decades ago:
We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may
always be free.<p>

Thank you.<p>
