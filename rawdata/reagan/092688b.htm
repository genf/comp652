Half a world away from this place of peace, the firing, the killing, the

finally, in this hemisphere, where only 12 years ago one-third of the people of
Latin America lived under democratic rule, some 90 percent do so today; and especially
in Central America, nations such as El Salvador, once threatened by the anarchy

another change, Mr. Secretary-General, a change that, if it endures, may go
down as one of the signal accomplishments of our history, a change that is a
cause for shaking of the head in wonder, is also upon us -- a change going to
the source of postwar tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of
ending the twin threats of our time: totalitarianism and thermonuclear world
war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
the first time, the differences between East and West -- fundamental
differences over important moral questions dealing with the worth of the
individual and whether governments shall control people or people control
governments -- for the first time, these differences have shown signs of
easing, easing to the point where there are not just troop withdrawals from
places like Afghanistan but also talk in the East of reform and greater freedom
of press, of assembly, and of religion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
fundamental differences remain. But should talk of reform become more than <span
class=GramE>that,</span> should it become reality, there is the prospect of not
only a new era in Soviet-American relations but a new age of world peace. For
such reform can bring peace, history teaches. And my country has always
believed that where the rights of the individual and the people are enshrined,
war is a distant prospect. For it is not people who make war; only governments
do that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

negotiations, some of them under U.N. auspices, involve a broad arms control
agenda -- strategic offensive weapons and space, nuclear testing and chemical
warfare -- whose urgency we have witnessed anew in recent days. And, Mr.
Secretary-General, the negotiators are busy. And over the last few years,
they've been engaged in more than an academic exercise. There is movement. The
logjam is broken. Only recently, when the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Much
of the reason for all of this goes back, I believe, to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> itself, to the small
chateau along the lake where I and the General Secretary of the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Union</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> had the first of
several fireside chats, exchanges characterized by frankness, but friendliness,
too. I said at the first meeting in Geneva that this was a unique encounter
between two people who had the power to start world war III or to begin a new
age of peace among nations. And I also said peace conferences, arms
negotiations, proposals for treaties could make sense only if they were part of
a wider context, a context that sought to explore and resolve the deeper,
underlying differences between us. I said to Mr. Gorbachev then, as I've said
to you before: Nations do not mistrust each other because they're armed;
they're armed because they mistrust each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
in that place, by that peaceful lake in neutral Switzerland, Mr. Gorbachev and
I did begin a new relationship based not just on engagement over the single
issue of arms control but on a broader agenda about our deeper differences --
an agenda of human rights, regional conflicts, and bilateral exchanges between
our peoples. Even on the arms control issue itself, we agreed to go beyond the
past, to seek not just treaties that permit building weapons to higher levels
but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced and even eliminated a whole
class of nuclear weapons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
was begun that morning in Geneva has shown results -- in the INF treaty; in my
recent visit to Moscow; in my opportunity to meet there with Soviet citizens

of human freedom. The results of that morning in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, the Iran-Iraq
negotiations, for example -- we see it today as <span class=SpellE>stonelike</span>
testimony to a failed dream of peace in another time. The <span class=SpellE>Palais</span>
des Nations was the headquarters of the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>League of Nations</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, an institution that
was to symbolize an end to all war. And yet today -- that institution and its
noble purpose ended with the Second World War; ended because the chance for
peace was not seized in the 1930's by the nations of the world; ended because
humanity didn't find the courage to isolate the aggressors, to reject schemes
of government that serve the state, not the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
are here today, Mr. Secretary-General, determined that no such fate shall
befall the United Nations. We are determined that the U.N. should succeed and
serve the cause of peace for humankind. So, Mr. Secretary-General, we realize
that, even in this time of hope, the chance of failure is real. But this
knowledge does not discourage us; it spurs us on. For the stakes are high. Do
we falter and fail now and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of future
generations? Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution and
see to it that, at last, freedom is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer
and that this place, this floor, shall be truly ``the world's last
battlefield?'' We are determined it shall be so. So, we turn now to the agenda
of peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my mind when I met with Mr.
Gorbachev in the Kremlin, as well as on the minds of Soviet citizens that I met
in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Moscow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. It is also an issue
that I know is of immediate importance to the delegates of this Assembly, who
this fall commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. That declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can
forget only at the greatest peril: that peace rests on one foundation --
observing ``the inalienable rights of all members of the human family.'' In a
century where human rights have been denied by totalitarian governments on a
scale never before seen in history, with so many millions deliberately starved
or eliminated as a matter of state policy -- a history, it has been said, of
blood, stupidity, and barbed wire -- few can wonder why peace has proved so
elusive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
let us understand: If we would have peace, we must acknowledge the elementary
rights of our fellow human beings. In our own land and in other lands, if we
would have peace, the trampling of the human spirit must cease. Human <span
class=GramE>rights is</span> not for some, some of the time. Human rights, as
the universal declaration of this Assembly adopted in 1948 proclaims, is ``for
all people and all nations,'' and for all time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of the U.N.
Those who starve in Ethiopia, those who die among the Kurds, those who face
racial injustice in South Africa, those who still cannot write or speak freely
in the Soviet Union, those who cannot worship in the Ukraine, those who
struggle for life and freedom on boats in the South China Sea, those who cannot
publish or assemble in Managua -- all of this is more than just an agenda item
on your calendar. It must be a first concern, an issue above others. For when

madman somewhere, major powers will not be faced with the single option of
massive retaliation but will instead have the chance of a saner choice: to
shield against an attack instead of avenging it. So, too, as defensive systems
grow in effectiveness, they reduce the threat and the value of greater and
greater offensive arsenals. Only recently, briefings I have received in the

implications. The number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate,
and more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons. This was a matter of

U.N. already is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions,
budgeting by consensus, and the establishment of program priorities. These

demonstrates that, time and again, in place after place, economic growth and
human progress make their greatest strides in countries that encourage economic
freedom; that individual farmers, laborers, owners, traders, and managers are
the heart and soul of development. Trust them, because where they're allowed to
create and build, where they're given a personal stake in deciding economic
policies and benefiting from their success, then societies become more dynamic,
prosperous, progressive, and free. We believe in freedom. We know it works.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this, Mr. Secretary-General and distinguished delegates, is the immutable

citadel of Marxism-Leninism itself. No, my country did not invent this synergy
of peace and freedom, but believe <span class=GramE>me,</span> we impose no
restrictions on the free export of our more than two centuries of experience
with it. Free people blessed by economic opportunity and protected by laws that
respect the dignity of the individual are not driven toward war or the
domination of others. Here, then, is the way to world peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
yet we Americans champion freedom not only because it's practical and beneficial
but because it is also just, morally right. And here, Mr. Secretary-General, I
hope you'll permit me to note that I have addressed this assemblage more than
any of my predecessors and that this will be the last occasion I do so. So I
hope, too, I may be permitted now some closing reflections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
world is currently witnessing another celebration of international cooperation.
At the Olympics we see nations joining together in the competition of sports,
and we see young people who know precious little of the resentments of their
elders coming together as one. One of our young athletes from a home of modest
means said that she drew the strength for her achievement from another source
of wealth. ``We were rich as a family,'' she said, about the love she was given
and the values she was taught. Mr. Secretary-General, I dare to hope that, in
the sentiment of that young athlete, we see a sign of the rediscovery of old
and tested values: values such as family, the first and most important unit of
society, where all values and learning begin -- an institution to be cherished
and protected; values, too, such as work, community, freedom, and faith. For
it's here we find the deeper rationale for the cause of human rights and world
peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
our own experience on this continent -- the American experience -- though
brief, has had one unmistakable encounter, an insistence on the preservation of
one sacred truth. It is a truth that our first President, our Founding Father,
passed on in the first farewell address made to the American people. It is a
truth that I hope now you'll permit me to mention in these remarks of farewell,
a truth embodied in our Declaration of Independence: that the case for
inalienable rights, that the idea of human dignity, that the notion of
conscience above compulsion can be made only in the context of higher law, only
in the context of what one of the founders of this organization,
Secretary-General <span class=SpellE>Dag</span> <span class=SpellE>Hammarskjold</span>,
has called devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are
ourselves. This is the endless cycle, the final truth to which humankind seems
always to return: that religion and morality, that faith in something higher,
are prerequisites for freedom and that justice and peace within <span
class=GramE>ourselves</span> is the first step toward justice and peace in the
world and for the ages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
this is a place of great debate and grave discussions. And yet I cannot help
but note here that one of our Founding Fathers, the most worldly of men, an
internationalist, Benjamin Franklin, interrupted the proceedings of our own
Constitutional Convention to make much the same point. And I cannot help but
think this morning of other beginnings, of where and when I first read those
words: ``And they shall beat their swords into plowshares . . .'' and ``your
young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams . . .'' This
morning, my thoughts go to her who gave me many things in life, but her most
important gift was the knowledge of happiness and solace to be gained in
prayer. It's the greatest help I've had in my Presidency, and I recall here
Lincoln's words when he said only the most foolish of men would think he could
confront the duties of the office I now hold without turning to someone
stronger, a power above all others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

possessed something that those who hold positions of power sometimes forget to

moment and have this opportunity. But had they been told it would happen, I
think they would have been a bit disappointed if I'd not spoken here for what
they knew so well: that when we grow weary of the world and its troubles, when
our faith in humanity falters, it is then that we must seek comfort and
refreshment of spirit in a deeper source of wisdom, one greater than ourselves.

so, if future generations do say of us that in our time peace came closer, that
we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice, it will be cause for
pride. But it shall be a cause of greater pride, still, if it is also said that
we were wise enough to know the deliberations of great leaders and great bodies
are but overture, that the truly majestic music -- the music of freedom, of
justice, and peace -- is the music made in forgetting self and seeking in
silence the will of Him who made us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
