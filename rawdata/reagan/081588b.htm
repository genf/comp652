custody of an institution called the Presidency, which belongs to our people.
Having temporary custody of this office has been for me a sacred trust and an
honor beyond words or measure. That trust began with many of you in this room
many conventions ago. <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Many's</span></span>
the time that I've said a prayer of thanks to all Americans who placed this
trust in my hands. And tonight, please accept again our heartfelt gratitude, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
a moment ago, you multiplied the honor with a moving tribute, and being only
human, there's a part of me that would like to take credit for what we've
achieved. But tonight, before we do anything else, let us remember that tribute
really belongs to the 245 million citizens who make up the greatest -- and the
first -- three words in our Constitution: ``We the People.'' It is the American
people who endured the great challenge of lifting us from the depths of
national calamity, renewing our mighty economic strength, and leading the way
to restoring our respect in the world. They are an extraordinary breed we call
Americans. So, if there's any salute deserved tonight, it's to the heroes
everywhere in this land who make up the doers, the dreamers, and the <span
class=SpellE>lifebuilders</span> without which our glorious experiment in
democracy would have failed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
convention brings back so many memories to a fellow like me. I can still
remember my first Republican convention: Abraham Lincoln giving a speech that
-- [laughter] -- sent tingles down my spine. No, I have to confess, I wasn't
actually there. The truth is, way back then, I belonged to the other party.
[Laughter] But surely we can remember another convention. Eight years ago, we
gathered in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Detroit</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> in a troubled time for
our beloved country. And we gathered solemnly to share our dreams. When I look
back, I wonder if we dared be so bold to take on those burdens. But in that
same city of Detroit, when the 20th century was only in its second year,
another great Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, told Americans not to hold back from
dangers ahead but to rejoice: ``Our hearts lifted with the faith that to us and
to our children it shall be given to make this Republic the mightiest among the
peoples of mankind.'' Teddy said those, years ago. In 1980 we needed every bit
of that kind of faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
year, it was our dream that together we could rescue </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and make a new
beginning, to create anew that shining city on a hill. The dream we shared was
to reclaim our government, to transform it from one that was consuming our
prosperity into one that would get out of the way of those who created
prosperity. It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to preserve
world peace and freedom and to recapture our national destiny. We made a determination
that our dream would not be built on a foundation of sand -- something called
``Trust Me Government'' -- but we would trust, instead, the American spirit.
And, yes, we were unashamed in believing that this dream was driven by a
community of shared values of family, work, neighborhood, peace, and freedom.
And on the night of </span><st1:date Year="1980" Day="17" Month="7"><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>July 17th, 1980</span></st1:date><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, we left with a mutual
pledge to conduct a national crusade to make </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> great again. We had
faith because the heroes in our midst had never failed us before. Tom Paine
knew what these Americans with character of steel could do when he wrote: ``<span
class=GramE>The</span> harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.''
And my fellow citizens, while our triumph is not yet complete, the road has
been glorious indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Eight
years ago, we met at a time when </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> was in economic chaos,
and today we meet in a time of economic promise. We met then in international
distress and today with global hope. Now, I think we can be forgiven if we
engage in a little review of that history tonight -- as the saying goes, just a
friendly reminder. I've been doing a little remembering of my own because of
all that inflated rhetoric by our friends in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Atlanta</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> last month. But then,
inflation is their specialty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
we came to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, Americans had just
suffered the two worst back-to-back years of inflation in 60 years. Those are
the facts, and as John Adams said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' Interest
rates had jumped to over 21 percent, the highest in 120 years, more than
doubling the average monthly mortgage payments for working families -- our
families. When they sat around the kitchen table, it was not to plan summer <span
class=GramE>vacations,</span> it was to plan economic survival. Facts are
stubborn things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Industrial
production was down, and productivity was down for 2 consecutive years. The
average weekly -- you missed me. [The President referred to a background
noise.] [Laughter] The average weekly wage plunged 9 percent. The median family
income fell 5\1/2\ percent. Facts are stubborn things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
friends on the other side had actually passed the single highest tax bill in
the 200-year history of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. Auto loans, because of
their policies, went up to 17 percent, so our great factories began shutting
down. Fuel costs jumped through the atmosphere, more than doubling. Then people
waited in gas lines as well as unemployment lines. Facts are stupid things --
stubborn things, I should say. [Laughter]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then there was the misery index. That was an election year gimmick they
designed for the 1976 campaign. They added the unemployment and inflation
rates. And it came to 13.4 percent in 1976, and they declared that our
candidate, Jerry Ford, had no right to seek re-election with that kind of
misery index. But 4 years later, in the 1980 campaign, they didn't mention the
misery index. Do you suppose it was because it was no longer 13.4 percent? In
those 4 years it had become almost 21 percent. And last month, in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

there was again no mention of the misery index. Why? <span class=GramE>Because
right now it's less than 9.2 percent.</span> Facts are stubborn things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

forbid our athletes to participate in the 1980 Olympics and to try to pull the
rug out from under our farmers with a grain and soybean embargo. And in those
years, on any given day, we had military aircraft that couldn't fly for lack of
spare parts and ships that couldn't leave port for the same reason or for lack
of a crew. Our Embassy in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pakistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. Our leaders answered
not that there was something wrong with our government but that our people were
at fault because of some malaise. Well, facts are stubborn things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
our friends last month talked of unemployment, despair, hopelessness, economic
weakness, I wondered why on Earth they were talking about 1978 instead of 1988.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
now we hear talk that it's time for a change. Well, ladies and gentlemen,
another friendly reminder: We are the change. We rolled up our sleeves and went
to work in January of 1981. We focused on hope, not despair. We challenged the
failed policies of the past because we believed that a society is great not

initiated reform of the unfairness in our tax system. And what do you know, the
top 5 percent of earners are paying a higher percentage of the total tax
revenue at the lower rates than they ever had before, and millions of earners

Yes, it's much too high. But the President doesn't vote for a budget, and the
President can't spend a dime. Only the Congress can do that. They blame the
defense increases for the deficit, yet defense spending today, in real dollars,
is almost exactly what it was 6 years ago. In a 6-year period, Congress cut
defense spending authority by over $125 billion. And for every $1 reduction in

my first budget, my first spending plan in 1982, the cumulative outlays and

the Constitution, and the liberals have said no every year. I called for the
line-item veto, which 43 Governors have, to cut fat in the budget, and the
liberals have said no. Every year I've attempted to limit their wild spending
sprees, and they've said no. They would have us believe that runaway budget deficits
began in 1981 when we took office. Well, let me tell you something: The fact
is, when they began their war on poverty in the middle sixties, from 1965
through 1980 -- in just those 15 years, the budgets increased to five times
what they had been, and the deficits went up to 52 times what they had been
