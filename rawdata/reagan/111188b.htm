<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We're
gathered today, just as we have gathered before, to remember those who served,
those who fought, those still missing, and those who gave their last full
measure of devotion for our country. We're gathered at a monument on which the
names of our fallen friends and loved ones are engraved, and with crosses
instead of diamonds beside them, the names of those whose fate we do not yet
know. One of those who fell wrote, shortly before his death, these words:
``Take what they have left and what they have taught you with their dying and
keep it with your own. And take one moment to embrace those gentle heroes you
left behind.'' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
today, Veterans Day, as we do every year, we take that moment to embrace the
gentle heroes of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Vietnam</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> and of all our wars. We
remember those who were called upon to give all a person can give, and we remember
those who were prepared to make that sacrifice if it were demanded of them in
the line of duty, though it never was. Most of all, we remember the devotion
and gallantry with which all of them ennobled their nation as they became
champions of a noble cause. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'm
not speaking provocatively here. Unlike the other wars of this century, of
course, there were deep divisions about the wisdom and rightness of the Vietnam
<span class=GramE>war</span>. Both sides spoke with honesty and fervor. And
what more can we ask in our democracy? And yet after more than a decade of
desperate boat people, after the killing fields of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Cambodia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, after all that has
happened in that unhappy part of the world, who can doubt that the cause for
which our men fought was just? It was, after all, however imperfectly pursued,
the cause of freedom; and they showed uncommon courage in its service. Perhaps
at this late date we can all agree that we've learned one lesson: that young
Americans must never again be sent to fight and die unless we are prepared to
let them win. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
beyond that, we remember today that all our gentle heroes of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Vietnam</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> have given us a lesson
in something more: a lesson in living love. Yes, for all of them, those who
came back and those who did not, their love for their families <span
class=GramE>lives.</span> <span class=GramE>Their love for their buddies on the
battlefields and friends back home lives.</span> Their love of their country
lives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
memorial has become a monument to that living love. <span class=GramE>The
thousands who come to see the names testify to a love that endures.</span> The
messages and mementos they leave speak with a whispering voice that passes
gently through the surrounding trees and out across the breast of our peaceful
nation. A childhood teddy bear, a photograph of the son or daughter born too
late to know his or her father, a battle ribbon, a note -- there are so many of
these, and all are testimony to our living love for them. And our nation itself
is testimony to the love our veterans have had for it and for us. Our
liberties, our values, all for which America stands is safe today because brave
men and women have been ready to face the fire at freedom's front. And we thank
God for them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
gentle heroes and living love and our memories of a time when we faced great
divisions here at home. And yet if this place recalls all this, both sweet and
sad, it also reminds us of a great and profound truth about our nation: that
from all our divisions we have always eventually emerged strengthened. Perhaps
we are finding that new strength today, and if so, much of it comes from the
forgiveness and healing love that our </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
too long a time, they stood in a chill wind, as if on a winter night's watch.
And in that night, their deeds spoke to us, but we knew them not. And their
voices called to us, but we heard them not. Yet in this land that God has
blessed, the dawn always at last follows the dark, and now morning has come.
The night is over. We see these men and know them once again -- and know how
much we owe them, how much they have given us, and how much we can never fully
repay. And not just as individuals but as a nation, we say we love you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
days, we show our love in many ways -- some of it through the Government. We
now fly the POW - MIA flag at this memorial on Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and
POW - MIA Recognition Day. This is a small gesture, but a significant one. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
